It sets a goal for the incorporation of biofuels for each year, which is obligatory for the entities providing fuels for consumption. In terms of energy content, the goals are as follows: 5.0% for 2011 and 2012; 5.5% for 2013 and 2014; 7.5% for 2015 and 2016; 9.0% for 2017 and 2018; 10.0% for 2019 and 2020. From 2015 onwards there will also be a specific target of 2.5% of energy content for incorporating diesel substitute biofuels. To prove compliance with the goal, incorporators have to submit a sufficient number of biofuel incorporation certificates (TdB) every year for cancellation. One TdB corresponds to 1 toe of biofuels introduced into consumption. Biofuels will have to comply with sustainability criteria in order to be eligible for TdBs. With regard to Small Dedicated Producers (SDP), Order No 320-E/2011 of 30 December 2011, which regulates Article 90(4) of the CIEC, stipulates the terms by which SDPs can continue to benefit from ISP exemptions. The biofuels they produce must comply with the sustainability criteria but are not entitled to TdBs.Decree-Law 8/2021 proceeds to update the targets for incorporating biofuels into fuels for consumption in the national territory for 2021.	2020 Climate and Energy Package (contains Directive 2009/29/EC, Directive 2009/28/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC and Decision No. 406/2009/EC of the Parliament and the Council ; see below)	Portugal	PRT	Energy		Mitigation	Decree Law	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Transportation		published

Government must also produce an annual global strategy stating how the government's foreign, development and trade policies ensure Denmarks role as a global driver in international climate policy.Section 13 of the Act provides for the repeal of the previous Climate Change Act (Act No. 716 of 25 June 2014)		Denmark	DNK	Economy-wide	Mitigation	Adaptation, Mitigation	Act	Paris Agreement, UNFCCC		published
														1292.0		Low Carbon Development Strategy	executive	This strategy sets out Guyana's plans for low carbon growth and reduced exploitation of forests with concomitant benefits for climate change mitigation. The LCDS is funded by international payments for ecosystem services, currently comprising a USD250m deal with the government of Norway. These funds are being invested in areas which it is thought will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes investments in the following areas:Adaptation and climate resilience, focussing on:Low carbon infrastructureHigh potential low carbon sectorsHinterland developmentHuman capitalAdaptation and climate resilience.Amerindian and hinterland development. A series of programmes focussing on:ElectrificationA development fund to be disbursed in accordance with community development funds.ICT access, focusing on expanded network of fibre cables.Facilitating investment in high-potential, low-carbon sectors, namely:Fruits and vegetablesAquacultureSustainable forestry and wood processing,Business process outsourcing,Eco-tourismBio-ethanolSustainably growing the extractive and forestry sectors. This includes:Improving the regulatory environment for forestry;Transition to more value-added production of timber including the integration of primary and secondary production;Increased efficiency in extraction, reduction of waste and increased recovery in timber processing.Since the mining sector is such an important contributor to Guyana's economy (c.20% GDP), mining is not required to cease under the terms of the LCDS. A Special Land Use Committee was established in 2010 which proposed the following projects:Strengthening Land Use Planning and Co-ordination among natural resource agenciesSustainable Land Management in the mining and forestry sectorsEnhanced Land ReclamationImproved Infrastructure in Mining DistrictsAmendments to Mining Act and Regulations In addition the Guyana Geology and Mining Commission is furthering efforts to reduce forest degradation including hiring 19 new mining inspectors to ensure adherence to mining regulations. Low-carbon transportation is envisaged as an activity mainly for the period after 2015, when up to USD2m will be allocated to planning work to look at how transportation infrastructure can be upgraded and benefit the economy.

The Strategy comes in line with the commitment made under the 2008 Climate Change Act that requires the country to reduce its emissions ""by at least 80% by 2050"". The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032). Beyond setting up the strategy to 2032, the document explores electrification, hydrogen and emissions removal as three pathways to 2050. The Strategy firstly highlights the image of leadership and situation of progress that the country has made in the last two decades. It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and ""could deliver between £60 billion and £170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030"". The document also mentions the co-benefits of actions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions on local air quality, public health, the economy and the environment. The Strategy also recalls the objective of energy affordability and the fact that leaving the EU represents an opportunity as ""domestic binding emissions targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation"". A number of more precise objectives are detailed as following: 1) develop green finance capabilities, including by setting up a green finance taskforce and providing up to £20 million to support a new clean technology early stage investment fund,- 2) develop a package of measures to support businesses to improve their energy productivity, by at least 20% by 2030,- 3) improving energy efficiency and aiming at reducing emissions from homes by 19% and energy use by 9%,- 4) rolling out low carbon heating,- 5) accelerate the shift to low carbon transport and reduce emissions by 29% by relying mostly on electric vehicles,- 6) deliver clean, smart, flexible power,- 7)enhance the benefits and value of domestic natural resources,- 8) and lead in the public sector. The government also commits £2.5 billion of investment in transport (33% of the total), power, cross-sector, smart systems, homes, business and industry, land use and waste."

														1687.0		CO2 Act (Act 641.71, fully revised version)	legislative	On November 25, 2020, the Federal Council adopted the revised CO2 ordinance, which is scheduled to enter into force on January 1, 2021. The revision consists in particular of extending the key climate protection instruments until the end of 2021. It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990.The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC. The document has been fully revised several times since the 2000 CO2 Act. The version in force and the 2020 Ordinance 641.711 have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020. The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are: - Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad - CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met - The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund. - CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations). - If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy - Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects - National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme - Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading - Prepare linking with EU ETS - Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74% - Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year - Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned - The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products - Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars. Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity. These aim at accommodating the 48,000 applications that were received since 2010. The 2000 CO2 Act focused on meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitment of overall GHG emission reductions of 8% in the 2008 - 2012 period compared to the 1990 base line. The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000. Those include: - CO2 levy for thermal fuels - Climate cent on transportation fuels - Voluntary commitments - Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration - Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms - Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020.

														1723.0		Act No. 5346 on Utilization of Renewable Energy Sources for the Purposes of Generating Electrical Energy (Renewable Energy Law)	legislative	This Act (also known as the Renewable Energy Law) encourages the use of renewable energy. This law encompasses the procedures and principles of the conservation of renewable energy resource areas, certification of the energy generated from these sources, and use of these sources. The measurable objective is to increase the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources by 30% by 2023. The Act governs the principles for the conservation of renewable resource areas and introduces incentives for domestic energy projects, providing feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable energy sources. The legal entity holding a generation licence is granted a \Renewable Energy Resource Certificate\ (RES Certificate) by the Electricity Markets Regulation Authority (EMRA) to identify and monitor the resource type in purchasing and sale of the electrical energy generated from renewable energy resources in the domestic and international markets. It creates a broad basis for an emerging domestic renewable energy market. Grid operators are obliged to provide access to the grid for renewable energy generators, and independent power producers can benefit from the feed-in tariff. Holders of energy retail licences are obliged to purchase a percentage of their total uptake from licensed generation companies holding a RES Certificate. The price of the electricity to be purchased under the Act should be the nationwide average of the electricity wholesale price of the previous year (determined by the EMRA). However a producer can sell the electrical energy generated for a higher price in the market if they are able to. Some highlights of the law include: - The reduction or cancellation of service fees as an incentive for those willing to build energy generation facilities to meet their own energy consumption needs. - Further incentives are available through a Council of Minister's Decree, such as investments for energy generation facilities, procurement of electro-mechanic systems within the country, research, development and production investments concerning solar energy units, and research and development investments for biomass energy. - Where there are sufficient geothermal energy resources, demand will be primarily met by geothermal and solar thermal energy resources. - In the event that the forests and the lands under private ownership of the Treasury or under the control or disposal of the State are used to generate electricity from renewable energy resources, these areas are leased to or right of way is given to the relevant parties. Any fees required for using this land is reduced by 85%. The law also stipulates that development plans that might have a negative impact on the use and efficiency of renewable energy resource areas can no longer be created on public land.The Act was amended in March 2020 by articles 26 and 27 of law 7226 to enable the Ministry of energy and renewable resources to ease the expropriation of private properties to build renewable capacity. Furthermore, it amends the procedures and principles regarding the evaluation of tariffs applied to support electricity production based on renewable energy sources and other revenues within the scope of the RES Support Mechanism, to grant the Ministry the power to regulate them.The Presidential Decree No.31248 sets out : 1) the prices in Schedule I in the Law will be applied until December 31, 2030 for Renewable Energy Resources (RER) certified production license holders that initiate their operations under the RER support mechanism between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021; 2) if the mechanical and/or electro-mechanical parts used in the RER-certified production facilities that initiate their operations between January 1, 2021 ad June 30, 2021 are manufactued domestically, the prices in Schedule II in the Law will be applied to the prices in Schedule I, for additional five years from the date os operation of the production facility for the electrical energy produced.

(There is also a 100% exemption from the Levy for certain energy-intensive metallurgical and mineralogical industries.) The first agreements ran from 2001 to 31 March 2013, and the second CCA scheme runs from 1 April 2013 to 21 December 2023. In 2004, the eligibility criteria for the UK's Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) were extended to cover other energy intensive sectors of industry not originally included within the arrangements for CCAs. Those sectors already eligible for CCAs were unaffected by the changes. CCA targets have been agreed with 53 industrial sectors across more than 9000 sites. It was announced in 2007 that the CCA scheme would be extended by 4 years to 2017, subject to state aid approval. This is to provide industry with greater certainty for the medium term, and enable CCAs to continue to contribute significantly to the UK's Climate Change Programme.The 2020 amendment extends the scheme in time.

														8588.0		Finance Law 2020, 2019, 2018 and Second Rectifying Finance Law for 2017	legislative	Carbon taxation: The budget law sets a trajectory for the carbon component of domestic consumption tax rates for the 2018-2022 period, with a more ambitious objective than that set by the law on the energy transition. Thus, the value of the carbon component of the tariffs for these taxes is set at 44.60 euros / tonne of CO2 in 2018 (instead of 39 euros initially), 55 euros in 2019 (against 47.5 euros) and 65, 40 euros in 2020 (against 56 euros), to reach 86.20 euros in 2022. In addition, it is expected in the new tariffs of TICPE (domestic consumption tax on energy products) a convergence of the tariff of diesel towards the gasoline tariffs in four years, ie by 2021. This measure leads to an increase in the fixed portion of the TICPE applicable to road diesel by ¬ 2.6 per hectolitre per year for four years, which is in addition to that of the carbon portion programmed for the period 2018-2022. Used vehicles: The rate of the additional tax on the tax on the registration certificates of used vehicles has been tightened. The objective is to encourage buyers to equip themselves with less polluting vehicles. Reinforcement of the ecological penalty: The environmental penalty for automobiles has been changed. It remains based on the only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of vehicles without taking into account their pollutant emissions (fine particles, nitrogen oxides ...) but the trigger threshold of the malus has been lowered from 127 to 120 grams of CO2 / km. The law sets a progressive scale ranging from 50 euros for the least emitting vehicles to 10,500 euros for those emitting 185 g of CO2 / km or more. Premium conversion to electric vehicles: EUR 388 million has been earmarked in the budget of the special purpose account Aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles to finance aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles (EUR 266 million) and the withdrawal of vehicles more pollutants (¬ 122 million). Electric bicycles: Faced with the bronca caused by the decision not to maintain beyond 31 January 2018 the bonus for the purchase of an electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike), State aid was finally extended by 5 millions of euros. It is however conditional on the payment of aid by a local authority and refocused on the most modest households. Energy transition tax credit (ISCED): The law of finance extends it for the year 2018 but hardens its conditions. As regards oil boilers, the eligibility criteria have been strengthened. The worst performers were excluded from ISCED as of January 1, 2018. In contrast, the eligibility of those meeting enhanced energy performance criteria, defined by decree, will be maintained until June 30, 2018 at a rate of 15%. The eligibility of glazed windows is maintained at a rate of 15%, only for taxpayers replacing single glazing with double glazing, until June 30, 2018. In contrast, the entrance doors and shutters are excluded from ISCED as of 1 January 2018.Civil aviation tax : 31 170 196 euros, reviewed assessment for 2019.

														1793.0		Vietnam's Green Growth Strategy and related PM Decisions	executive	This document was implemented through Decision 1393/QD-TTg. Green growth is a means to achieve a low carbon economy and to enrich Vietnam's natural capital through sustainable development. It notes that GHG emissions and removals are gradually becoming essential indicators in social-economic development, and attempts to normalise this within Vietnam's development framework. The central pillars of the programme are - Low Carbon Growth - Greening of Production - Greening of Lifestyles The strategy includes the development of tax incentives for high-technology, scientific research and technology development firms in the environment sector. They will pay 10% tax, a discount against the baseline 25% tax rate, for the first 15 years of operation. Further incentives come from import tax exemptions to encourage the import and use of technology related to environmental monitoring, analysis and the development of clean energy. In addition, taxation will be increased on water exploitation, from 1% to 3% for the exploitation of surface water, and 3% to 8% for the exploitation of groundwater. The strategy contains numerous targets. For 2020: - GDP per capita doubled compared to 2010 - Reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 1.5-2% per year - Reduce intensity of GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 8-10% or double the target with international support For 2030: - Reduce total GHG emissions by at least 1% per year without and 2% with international support. - Environmental degradation is addressed and natural capital stocks are to be improved while access to and use of clean and green technology is significantly enhanced. For 2050: - Vietnam has mainstreamed Green Economic Development.The PM Decision No.403/2014 approved the National Action Plan on Green growth in Vietnam for the Period of 2014-2020.

The document establishes a number of measures addressing energy demand, including national energy efficiency targets, energy efficiency performance certificates, minimum standards for power-consuming products, supporting investments in energy saving, and applying demand-side management techniques. It also establishes that energy supply should consist of a mix between cogeneration, renewables, grid modernisation, and nuclear. With this end, the EPP fixes measurable targets, for example: increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030; boost the share of biofuels in the transportation fuels market to 10%; and building of at least one biogas agricultural plant in each commune by 2020. The EPP 2030 strategy document establishes the need to gradually increase the share of bio-components fuel in transportation fuels so as to meet planned objectives. As a result, the government established differentiated fuel taxes in a way that to promotes alternative fuels.PEP 2040 was officially released on September 8, 2020. It amends PEP 2030 and mandates a progressive phase-out of hard coal and lignite, investments in nuclear and renewable energy sources.

														1549.0		Philippine Disaster Reduction and Management Act (RA 10121)	legislative	The Act shifted the policy environment and the way the country deals with disasters from mere response to preparedness. RA 10121 provides a comprehensive, all-hazard, multi-sectoral, inter-agency, and community-based approach to disaster risk management through the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework. A National Disaster Risk Management Plan (NDRMP) is being formulated, developed, and implemented as the master plan that will provide the strategies, organisation, tasks of concerned agencies and local government units, and other guidelines in dealing with disasters or emergencies. Through this plan, a coherent, integrated, efficient, and responsive disaster risk management at all levels will hopefully be achieved. The law also promotes the development of capacities in disaster management at the individual, organisational, and institutional levels. A very important feature of this law is its call for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in physical and land-use planning, budget, infrastructure, education, health, environment, housing, and other sectors. RA 10121 also recognises local risk patterns and trends and decentralisation of resources and responsibilities and thus encourages the participation of NGOs, private sectors, community-based organisations, and community members in disaster management. It inhibits the full participation of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities in governance. The approach tends to be 'response-oriented' or 'reactive.' This is evidenced by the widespread emphasis on post-disaster relief and short-term preparedness, such as forecasting and evacuation, rather than on mitigation and post- disaster support for economic recovery. Moreover, the Act mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in every province, city and municipality, and a Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC) in every barangay. The Strategic National Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for 2009-2019 aims to enhance the capacities of Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils. Finally, RA10121 provides for the calamity fund to be used in support of disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention, and preparedness activities for the potential occurrence of disasters and not just for response, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.

The REP notes that a Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA) will be established under the 1994 Companies Act to act as a focal point for sustainable energy development and promotion. SEDA will create market opportunities and start-up business models for sustainable energy technologies, such as energy services companies and rural energy providers' and provide financial support in the research and development of renewable energy technology'. The REP further outlines three core provisions: -Renewable energy project(s): the sale of electricity from plants requires a power generation licence from The Energy and Mineral Resources Division (BERC) if the capacity is 5 MW or more. - The government and the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA), in consultation with BERC, will create a regulatory framework encouraging generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. - BERC shall approve the energy tariff in consultation with the government and SEDA as per the provision of the BERC Act 2003 if the capacity of renewable energy project(s) is 5MW or more. Electricity distributors may offer 'green energy' tariffs, which provide consumers an opportunity to co-finance through their electricity bills the development of new renewable energy sources.

Estonias long-term objective is to transition to a low-carbon economy, which means gradually reforming the economy and energy system to be resource-efficient, productive and environmentally-friendly in line with the objectives.The use of fossil fuels will be reduced and CO2 emissions will decrease due to energy savings in transport, agriculture, waste management and industrial processes and small-scale power production where energy is produced by facilities with a rated output of less than 20 MWh.To maintain final energy consumption in the period 2021-2030 requires annual energy savings equivalent to 0.8% of the average final energy consumption in the period 2016-2018 Estonia has the highest primary energy intensity of all the EU Member States. Consumption of primary energy is forecast to drop by a quarter in the period 2017-2030.The share of renewables will be increased by changing fossil fuel boilers to renewable fuels, increasing electricity generation from fuel free sources and increased use of biofuels in transport. In the electricity and heating sector, the plan aims at increasing renewable sources.

The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transportation) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium's climate strategy:Energy production optimisationEfficient use of energyIndustrial sector initiativesDevelopment of sustainable transportPrioritisation of sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystemsContinued efforts in waste managementIncreased climate change researchAwareness-raising on climate change mitigation optionsIncreased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissionsUse of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM)Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012). Since 2013, the National Climate Commission has been engaged in extending this Plan up to 2020, a process slowed down by the lack of agreement among the regions and the National government on burden-sharing of non-ETS targets for 2013 - 2020 as well as the share of renewable energies per region. The Agreement establishes a National Climate Commission which monitors the implementation of the co-operation agreement, co-ordinates internal climate policy, and monitors and evaluates the National Climate Plan implementation and fulfilment of reporting obligations to the European and international level. The main tasks of the Commission thus include:Approval of official reports under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and EU Directives and DecisionsEvaluation of co-ordination and co-operation between the federal and interregional level on implementation of policies and measures adopted on the basis of the National Climate Plan.Advice to the Co-ordinating Committee for International Environmental Policy and the Interdepartmental Commission for Sustainable Development.

														9493.0		Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria	executive	The National Energy and Climate (ENCP) Plan is a ten-year integrated document mandated by the European Union to each of its member states in order for the EU to meet its overall greenhouse gases emissions targets.Austria's plan aims in particular to improve the development of transport, a sector which still needs improvement in Austria, especially in build-up areas and along transit routes. In that context, decarbonisation implies several objectives and measures : 1) the reduction of GHG emissions (non-ETS) by 36% compared to 2005, 2) to strengthen and develop public transport, 3) a mobility management for businesses, towns and cities, municipalities, regions and tourism, 4) e-mobility in private transport, 5) to green the standard fuel consumption tax and the engine-related insurance tax, 6) to input tax deduction for electric bicycles and motorcycles. Decarbonisation implies measures in the sectors of buildinds, agriculture, forestry, waste management, fluorinated gases and spatial planning. For the energy, the main objective is to increase the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption of energy to 46-50%, and source 100% of electricity consumption from renewables (nationally/balanced).To achieve this goal, the main instrument remains on taxation (tax advantages/exemptions). The plan also aims to ensure measures concerning : 1) the energy efficiency dimension, 2) the internal energy market dimension, 3) the research/innovation/competitiveness, 4) the evaluation and monitoring.

														1755.0		Climate Change Act	legislative	The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability. The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set. The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping. The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments. The recommended budget and its latest progress report, the CCC (Committee on Climate Change) listed some recommendations in the form of priorities for policy development, including: Enabling mature low carbon energy sources (e.g. onshore wind) to come to marketDefining how energy efficiency improvements shall be financed and deliveredIncreasing adoption of low carbon heat, which includes policies to overcoming behavioural barriersExtending vehicle efficiency targets through the 2020s, coupled with policies to increase use of electric vehiclesIn order to decarbonise effectively by 2050, the CCC has called for all new investment from 2020 onwards in power to be low carbon, excluding back-up and balancing plant. From 2035 onwards, the same will apply to all investments in transport and head.

														1567.0		Resolution of Council of Ministers 20/2013 establishing the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE 2016) and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PNAER 2020)	executive	This Resolution established the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE 2016) and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PNAER 2020). It repeals the PNAEE 2015, approved by the Resolution of Council of Ministers 80/2008, of 16 May 2008. It is underpinned by the idea that reducing oil dependency reduces the foreign trade deficit, as well as CO2 emissions. Within the framework of European '20-20-20' targets, Portugal established a general target to be achieved by 2020, to reduce primary energy consumption by 25% along with a specific target for Public Administration of achieving a reduction of 30%. As part of the plan to use energy from indigenous renewable sources, Portugal aims to have 31% of final gross energy consumption and 10% of energy for transport derived from renewable sources, at the least possible cost the economy. It also aims to reduce the nation's energy dependence and ensure security of supplies, by promoting a balanced energy mix. The PNAEE and PNAER establish ways of achieving these targets and international commitments with regard to energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources. In addition to intensifying the goals, the plans also identify existing barriers and the potential for improvement with a view to establishing the most suitable programmes and measures for complying with its commitments. The revision of the PNAEE is based on three lines of intervention: (i) action (suitability of the measures); (ii) monitoring (review of the methods for monitoring results), and (iii) governance (redefining the PNAEE governance model). To this end, an estimated impact analysis was carried out for all the measures in the PNAEE, in accordance with European norms on monitoring energy efficiency plans and measures. The Resolution aims to operationalise the Energy Efficiency Fund and integrate it with other programmes to support energy efficiency, so as to optimise incentives. The Resolution takes into consideration measures already established by the National Climate Change Programme (PNAC). The implementation of PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should benefit from a common structure tracking and monitoring of the progress and results of the measures and actions taken in each Plan. The PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should also be articulated with the structure of supervision and monitoring of the PNAC in 2020, allowing the provision of information for assessing national commitments energy and climate. Resolution 20/2013 attributes the responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the PNAEE and the PNAER to the minister responsible for the energy sector.

The Concept was developed within the framework of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, 2002) by the Ministry of Environment with support from UNDP, UNEP-EU, as well as scientists and experts. This policy calls for the increase of the environmental sustainable index up to 10% by 2012, 15% by 2018, and 25% by 2024. The Concept lays out the four stages of development:Preparation stage (2007-2009) is to establish the institutional readiness to integrate sustainable development principles into all aspects of political and economics spheresIn the first stage (2010-2012) the country aims to become one of the fifty most competitive countries in the world economyDuring the second stage (2013-2018) the focus is on quality of life for citizens, decrease in environmental degradation, and increase of environmental sustainabilityThe third stage (2019-2024) Kazakhstan will achieve international standards of sustainable development The general goal of the Concept is 'to achieve an economic, social, environmental, and political balance of the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan as a base for improvement of quality of life and provision for the competitiveness of the country in the long-term period.' The decree lays out eight principles for Kazakhstan's sustainable development broadly related to improving the economic and social development indicators of the country. The principles are followed by 16 priorities, a number of which are related directly or indirectly to climate change mitigation or adaption. Those priorities are:Introduction of sustainable models of production and consumptionIntroduction of innovative environmentally safe technologiesDevelopment of sustainable transportation systemsEnergy efficiency and energy savingDevelopment of science and education for sustainable developmentPrevention and alleviation of environmental threats to the human healthDecrease of emissions, including GHG and ODSAccess to quality drinking waterSolutions to trans-boundary environmental problemsWaste management The section on environmental sustainability highlights the need to follow a development path that decreases the anthropogenic impact on climate change. The plan stipulates that the country should use national and local budgets in addition to international loans and grants to achieve its sustainable development goals; the adoption and enforcement of 'polluter pays' policies meant to penalise those entities that contaminate the environment (including excessive CO2emissions), the introduction of trading emissions quota system (the ETS, now in its first year of operation).

														1376.0		The First National Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Plan and Government decision 2508	executive	The National Plan for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions aims to reduce emissions by 20% compared to a business-as-usual scenario by 2020. The main strategies relate to energy efficiency, green building, and transportation. A key element was a government-sponsored programme of subsidies administered jointly by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Investment Centre in the Ministry of Economy, aimed at encouraging investments in energy efficiency and GHG reduction projects and at advancing new Israeli technologies. The Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Economy grants additional assistance (ILS40 million, USD10.4 million) to approved projects, based on new Israeli technologies (first installation). Key elements of the National Plan included:Reducing residential energy consumption - (responsibility of Ministry of Energy and Water Resources)Support for investments in GHG emissions reductions (responsibility of Ministry of Environmental Protection)Support for Israeli technologies and green innovation (responsibility of Ministry of Economy)Pilot projects for green building and green building teaching and training (responsibility of Ministry of Environmental Protection)Pilot project for retrofits ((responsibility of Ministry of Construction and Housing)Education and awareness (responsibility of Ministries of Environmental Protection and Transportation)Promotion of energy efficiency (responsibility of Ministries of Environmental Protection and Economy)Setting standards for energy efficiency (responsibility of Ministry of Energy and Water Resources)Transportation (responsibility of Transportation Ministry) - including energy efficient components in imported cars and eco-driving education The approved budget for the implementation of the plan was ILS2.2 billion (USD573 million) until 2020. During 2011-2012 ILS106 million (USD27.6 million) were allocated to 208 projects, with a reduction potential of ~ 450,000 tons of CO2eq per year and a savings potential of approximately ILS100 million (USD26 million) per year in electricity and fuel costs. The programme leveraged investments of more than ILS 550 million (USD143 million) by industries, businesses and municipalities during those first two years. The inter-ministerial committee was set to begin to examine additional reduction measures for the years 2013-2014, including renewable energies. In July 2013, however, the National Plan for the Reduction of GHG Emissions was frozen for three years by the Ministry of Finance, with the passage of the 2013 budget. This meant the cessation of many of the GHG mitigation programs. Only those that were already funded in previous budgets or that could be funded via other means will continue.

The framework law aims to:set out the rights and duties, inherent to the environment and sustainable development, recognized to physical and moral persons, and proclaim the principles that must be respected by the State, local authorities, public institutions, State-owned enterprises and their corporate partners, both in the development of their action plans and at the level of their implementationstrengthen the legal protection of resources and ecosystems by listing the types of actions or measures the State proposes to take in order to fight against all forms of pollution and nuisance and provide a high level of effective protection to such resourcesestablish sustainable development as a core value shared by all components of the society, but also as an approach to be covered in public policies for the global and sectoral development, and require that the government develops a national strategy for sustainable development in order to allow all parties involved to understand the main directions in this field to which they should referdefine the responsibilities and commitments that all stakeholders - government, local authorities, public institutions and State-owned enterprises, private enterprises, NGOs and citizens - must respect in terms of environment and sustainable developmentplan institutional, economic and financial measures in order to establish a system of environmental governance characterized by the efficiency and coherence of actions, particularly in terms of assessment, awareness, education and social communication for the environment and sustainable developmentlay the foundations for a system of environmental responsibility with a mechanism for compensating damages caused to the environment, and decide the establishment of an environmental police to strengthen the ability of the authorities to ensure proper environmental enforcement It considers the sectors and activities related to energy, water, forests, marine fisheries, agriculture, transport, tourism, urbanism, construction, waste management and industry as having a high potential for sustainability, and a priority in terms of achieving sustainable development. To this end, the government authorities and relevant institutions in charge of these sectors and activities are required to ensure the adoption of concrete sustainability measures in their management and wide dissemination of these measures. The framework law explicitly mentions the fight against climate change. Environmental protection involves the promotion of sustainable uses of resources, the fight against pollution and the combined effects of desertification and climate change. It calls for strengthening national capacities to promote adaptation to climate change, as well as for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to fight against energy waste.

														1418.0		Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Law, No. 3 of 2010	legislative	The renewable energy and energy efficiency law provides the legislative framework to encourage exploitation of enable energy sources, further supply-side energy efficiency and streamline private sector investment through incentives. The law states that to achieve the objectives the government will focus on:Increasing investment in renewable energy extraction, thereby increasing the proportion of renewables in the energy mixWorking towards sustainable development through environment-friendly energy extractionPursuing rational and efficient energy extraction The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is in charge of enacting the law, and a first order of business was the identification of geographic areas for renewable energy exploitation. These areas, co-ordinated with the Ministry's Energy Master Plan, will be prioritised for development in a Land Use List, approved by the Council of Ministers. Areas identified for exploitation that are 'treasury land' (owned by the state) shall be allocated to renewable energy projects. Lands owned by individuals shall be purchased based on existing legislative authority, if approved by the Council of Ministers. In addition to hosting a competitive bidding processes to develop projects on lands prioritised on the Land Use List, individuals or projects may approach the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources with a specific proposal to develop an extraction site on any lands in the country (already identified on the Land Use List or not) which have not already been allocated by a public tender. The law outlines the requirements for such proposals and a general outline for the decision making process. The law specifies the purchasing arrangements of the electricity from bulk suppliers; much of this framework is pre-existing in the General Electricity Law. Under the renewable energy law, individual homes may also produce their own renewable electricity, and sell any surplus energy back to the grid, with the price set by the purchase tariff specified in the Bulk Supply Licensees or the Retail Supply Licensees. This law establishes the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund, which shall be administratively and financially independent. The Fund is overseen by the Board of Directors of the Fund, composed of the vice-chairman of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources; the secretaries-general of the Ministries of Environment, Planning and International Co-operation, and Finance; a commissioner nominated by the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Commission, and three representatives of the private sector appointed by the Council of Ministers.

														1407.0		The Natural Resources Conservation Authority (Air Quality) Regulations	executive	Regulates the emissions of particulates and substances deleterious to human health. This includes the licensing of premises and plants which produce such polluting substance; fees for discharge; and inspection. The Natural Resources Conservation Authority Act enabled the implementation of the Air Quality Regulations and these regulations legislate for the licensing, monitoring, and collection of fees for emissions. These emissions specifically include the term GHGs, and name these. The regulations seem to refer only to industrial sources, specifying facilities and stack emissions. The implication of these regulations is that industrial emissions will be licensed, monitored and have fees levied against them. Every owner of a major facility must apply for an air pollutant discharge licence and licensees must submit emissions reports for each calendar year. This report should contain estimates of the emissions for the year, based on the following details:Continuous emission monitoring dataCalculation of SO2 emissions based on fuel use and sulphur content data (combustion processes in which exhaust gases do not come in contact with products)Most recent and representative stack monitoring measurements conducted in the previous five years and activity data for the year for which emissions are estimatedAP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and activity data for the yearAP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and plant capacity dataMass balance (including fuel use data) based on the two previous years or the most recent representative yearOther approved methods supported by calculation and documentation Further, the Regulations impose Discharge Fees on Licensees. Crucially, these fees are waived for emissions derived from the burning of renewable fuels, such as landfill gas and agricultural waste. Where the regulations are not adhered to, sanctions may be applied to the licence holder. The management Authority (individual or body authorised under the regulations) may then:Issue a control orderImpose administrative penaltiesSuspend or revoke any licenceRefuse an application for renewal of any licenceApply to the Supreme Court for an injunction to prohibit the operation of the facility or any source at the facility The regulations also mandate the development of a National Emissions Inventory to track air quality, which should be made available to the public and reported to the House of Representatives at least once every three years.

														1405.0		Ministry of Energy and Mining long-term National Energy Policy 2009-2030	executive	Developed in parallel with the Vision 2030 Jamaica document, the overarching goal of the National Energy Policy is to develop: 'a modern, efficient, diversified and environmentally sustainable energy sector providing affordable and accessible energy supplies with long-term energy security and supported by informed public behaviour on energy issues and an appropriate policy, regulatory and institutional framework'. The Strategic Framework underpinning the policy addresses both the supply and demand energy issues Jamaica faces. It prioritises seven key areas:Security of energy supply through diversification of fuels as well as development of renewable energy sourcesModernising the country's energy infrastructureDevelopment of renewable energy sourcesConservation and efficiency in energy useDevelopment of a comprehensive governance/regulatory framework for the energy sectorEnabling government ministries and agencies to be models/best practice for the rest of society in terms of energy managementEco-efficiency in industries Finding environmentally sustainable energy solutions is central to the document. It seeks to facilitate cultural, institutional and technological change in a way that supports 'aggressive' advances in energy efficiency and conservation, minimises greenhouse emissions and ulti-mately provides green growth. These energy efficiency and conservation goals are seen as 'no regrets' mitigation actions that can have positive impacts on society and the economy, principally by reducing costs and dependency on fossil fuel imports. Among stated goals of the policy is that Jamaica realises its energy resource potential through the development of renewable energy sources and enhances its international competitiveness and energy security while reducing its carbon footprint. Five sub-policies exist to support the National Energy Policy, namely:A Carbon Emissions Trading Policy developed to address Jamaica's participation in the Clean Development MechanismNational Renewable Energy Policy 2010-2030National Energy from Waste Policy 2010-2030Energy Conservation and Efficiency PolicyBiofuels Policy Overall the policy propose to reduce the percentage of petroleum in the country's energy supply mix from the current 95% (does not state to what level) and increase the percentage of renewables in the energy mix with proposed targets of 11% by 2012, 12.5% by 2015 and 20% by 2030.

It regulates the restructuration of feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic plants (capacity > 200 kW). Starting from 1st January 2015, the feed-in-tariffs are to be paid based on one of the following three options, to be selected by the owner of the plant: a) Current feed-in-tariffs will be reduced depending on the actual remaining period of life of the plant (from 25% for 12 years remaining to 17% for more than 19 years remaining) and distributed over a period of 24 years starting from the grid connection date instead of 20 years b) The fixed reduction of feed-in-tariffs, when the owner of the plant can opt for a reduction of the current feed-in-tariffs by a fixed percentage over the 20-year period (same as before). The Law now provides for the following different percentages, depending on the nominal capacity of the plant:6% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 200 - 500kW;7% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 500 -900kW;8% for plants with nominal capacity above 900 kW. c) The variable restructuration of feed-in-tariffs, which provides for current feed-in-tariffs to be reduced initially by a certain percentage and increased, by the same amount, at a later stage. The aim of introducing such option is to ensure annual savings of EUR600m (USD753m) over 2015-2019. In addition, the Law provides that owners can sell up to 80% of their expected future feed-in-tariffs to a third investor (selected among European leading financial operators through competitive tenders).

The functions of the SEAI are:To promote and assist environmentally and economically sustainable production, supply and use of energyTo promote and assist energy efficiency and renewable sources of energyTo promote and assist the reduction of GHG emissions and transboundary air pollutants associated with the production, supply and use of energyTo promote and assist the minimising of the impact on the environment of the production, supply and use of energyTo promote and assist research, development and demonstration of technologies connected with the abovementioned objectivesTo provide advice, information and guidance to Ministers, ministerial bodies and energy suppliers and users relating to the abovementioned matters The SEAI has the powers necessary to perform abovementioned functions. This includes the following: cooperating with the Central Statistics Office and acting as an agent of the Office; licensing, regulation and control of activities; initiation, development, administration, promotion of and participation in schemes and programmes. An amendment in 2012 conferred a number of additional responsibilities on the SEAI to give affects to EU Directives. The SEAI is required to develop a scheme of certification or equivalent qualification, for installers of renewable energy sources, including biomass, solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps. It is to provide information on the availability, environmental benefits and net cost benefits of these energy sources and make guidance available to other consumers, in particular planners and architects, in relation to uses of energy from renewable sources in planning and building or renovating industrial or residential areas. The SEAI should work to raise awareness of, and offer training programmes relating to, renewable sources in order to inform the public as comprehensively as possible of their benefits and practicalities. It must therefore encourage the use of certain, particularly efficient, biomass technologies, heat pumps and solar thermal energy technologies as well as other appropriately certified equipment based on European standards. A 2014 amendment introduced the certification scheme for installers of biomass, heat pump, shallow geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energies. Installer certification or qualification shall be given by accredited training programme or training provider.

														1131.0		Forest Law (Law No.7575)	legislative	The 1996 Forest Law establishes the protection, conservation and management of forest areas as a priority and central responsibility of the State. The government is in charge of regulating and supervising the use and exploitation of forest resources in a sustainable manner. In addition, the government should seek to improve living conditions for rural communities. The law forbids land cover changes in forest and calls for moderate use of natural resources. At the institutional level, the law establishes the creation of the National Forest Office, in charge of proposing policies and programmes on forest issues, as well as managing the activities of projects in place, working closely with local communities and other governmental bodies. Operating on the basis of decentralisation of policy-making, the 1996 law also supported the Regional Environmental Councils, which have played a limited role so far. Creating the Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Programme, the law rewards landholders for their environmental services, which include:mitigation of GHG emissions through emissions reduction and carbon fixation, capture, storage or absorption;protection of water for urban, rural or hydroelectric use;biodiversity conservation for conservation, sustainable use, scientific investigation or genetic enhancement; andprotection of ecosystems or scenic natural beauty for tourism or science. In addition, Forest Conservation Certificates (CCB) are available, although less used due to their long-term nature. To be eligible for the CCB scheme, forest resources should not have been extracted in the two years previous to the application and should remain preserved for a minimum of 20 years of the validity of the Certificate. A share of 5% of the amount granted should be designated to the Forest Fund. The Law establishes the Forest Fund aiming at: fostering capacity building and research activities on best practices in the forest sector; preventing fires and plagues in forest areas; promoting reforestation plans; protecting soil; preventing water and air contamination; promoting forest products; building institutional capacities. A third of the funds collected annually from the tax on fuels and hydrocarbons are to be dedicated to the PES Programme for GHG emissions reduction and to programmes for protection and support of biodiversity through forest protection, conservation and reforestation. The budget of the Fund is formed mainly of contributions from the Ministry of Environment and Energy, donations from international and national organisations and entities, taxes, fines and revenues associated to forest activities, and forest bonds. Additionally, the law sets up the National Forest Financing Fund (FONAFIFO), to finance the activities of small and medium producers that relate to forestation and reforestation, restoration of degraded land, technological changes and sustainable use of forest resources. Holding legal personality, the Fund raises funds for the payment of environmental services that contribute to the development of the natural resources sector.

														1115.0		The Canadian Environmental Protection Act 1999 (CEPA 1999) (S.C. 1999, c. 33)	legislative	The CEPA 1999, or the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 1999, modifies the former Canadian Environmental Protection Act of 1988. It sets out a framework to manage and control toxic substances released from all stages of economic activities: from development, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, storage, use up to disposal. This law is administered by the Environment Canada and to assess toxicity of substances or to develop associated regulations, objectives, guidelines and codes of practice the Ministry collaborates with the Health Canada. Among the list of toxic substances, the following GHGs are subject for regulation under this act: chlorofluorocarbon, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. Key changes made under the CEPA 1999 are as follows:Implementation of pollution preventionIntroduction of new procedures to investigate and assess toxicity of substancesIntroduction of new procedures to set new requirements and controls for substances that the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have determined to be toxic or capable of becoming toxicNew provisions on animate products of biotechnologyNew provisions on fuels, international air and water pollution, motor emissions, release of nutrients into water that may cause excessive growth of aquatic vegetation and environmental emergenciesNew provisions to regulate the environmental impacts on government operations and to protect the environment on and in relation to federal land and aboriginal landNew provisions on disposal of wastesNew provisions on export and import of wastesProvision of new powers for enforcement officers and analysts appointed by the Minister of the EnvironmentSpecify criteria for courts to impose a sentence on an offenderEncourage participation of citizens in making decisions on environmental matters: new rights to send written comments or notices of objection to the Minister of the Environment This was later amended by the Bill C-33 (26 June 2008) to include period and comprehensive reviews of the environmental and economic impacts of biofuel production in Canada. This amendment bill is also known as Biofuel Bill, as it established a framework within which the government can regulate biofuels content. This includes the tracking of exports to make accurate calculations of the volume of renewable fuels as a percentage of the total fuel used in Canada, and the lifting of administrative burdens that would be placed on small producers and importers. The Biofuel Bill allows the federal government to implement regulations requiring 5% average renewable content in gasoline by 2010. Subsequent regulations will also require 2% average renewable content in diesel and heating oil by 2012 on successful demonstration of renewable diesel fuel use under the range of Canadian environmental conditions. In addition, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has been regulating sections of the Environmental Protection Act which directly address climate change and the emission of GHG, including:Passenger Automobile and Light Truck GHG Emissions Regulations (2010), which establishes GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2011-2016, and the new Regulations for Passenger Automobile and Light Truck GHG Emissions (2012), which establishes GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks of model years 2017 and beyond.Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (2012), which sets performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electricity generation units.Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine GHG Emissions Regulations (2013), which establishes GHG emission standards for on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines (e.g. buses, tractors and refuse trucks).Renewable Fuels Regulations (2013), which aims to reduce GHG emissions by requiring an average 5% renewable fuel content in gasoline and 2% renewable content in diesel fuel. Within the remit of this law, the Government announced the introduction of the clean fuel standard regulatory framework to achieve 30 megatonnes of annual reductions in GHG emissions by 2030, contributing to Canada's effort to achieve its overall GHG mitigation target of 30% emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. The Government further projects to introduce regulations on the reduction in the release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (upstream Oil and Gas Sector)		Canada	CAN	Water,Waste,Transportation,Energy		Mitigation	Law	Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation		published
														1097.0		Law 11.284/2006, establishing the management of Public Forests, Brazilian Forest Service and National Fund for Forest Development	legislative	This law establishes principles for the management of public forests for sustainable production; institutes, within the structure of the Ministry of Environment, the Brazilian Forest Service (BFS); and creates the National Fund for Forest Development. In order to attest compliance with the forest management principles established by this bill, forest concession-holders should undertake independent forest audits, every 3 years at a maximum, and at their own cost. Additionally, the National Environment System (Sisnama) agencies are responsible for control and environmental inspection. The National Fund for Forest Development has a Consultative Council formed by members from the federal administration and civil society charged with overseeing the disbursement of funds and evaluating performance. Regarding REDD+/land use policies, the bill establishes the following principles for public forest management:Protection of ecosystems, land, water, biodiversity and associated cultural valueEfficient and rational use of forests in line with local, regional and national sustainable development targetsRespect for local communities' right of access to and use of public forests and the benefits associated with conservationPromotion of local processing, increased value-added of forest products and services, industrial diversification, technological development, and capacity-building of local entrepreneurs and labour-forceFree access to information regarding public forest managementPromotion and dissemination of research on forestry related to conservation, restoration and sustainable use of forestsPromotion of knowledge and awareness of forest conservation, recovery and sustainable use; andCreation of stable and secure conditions for the promotion of long-term investment in forest conservation and recovery The National Fund for Forest Development (NFFD) is instituted with the purpose of promoting sustainable forestry activities as well as technological innovation in the sector. Among other things, the Fund's resources should be channelled to technical assistance, monitoring and verification, recuperation of degraded areas, rational economic use of forests and environmental education. The Fund only finances projects from public institutions or not-for-profit private institutions. The Brazilian Forest Service (BSF) is created with the exclusive mandate of managing public forests; it is equally the managing authority of the NFFD. The BSF is responsible for: training, capacity-building and technical assistance; promoting of sustainable timber and wood and sustainable forest production in general; and market scoping for forest products and services.

														1085.0		The Mother Earth Law and Integral Development to Live Well, Law No 300	legislative	The Mother Earth Law is a piece of legislation that epitomises Bolivia's dedication to sustainable development, respecting the balance between human life and the natural environment, and prioritising the rights and knowledge of the country's majority indigenous population. The expressed objective of the law is to 'establish the vision and fundamentals of integral development in harmony and balance with Mother Earth to Live Well, guaranteeing the continued capacity of Mother Earth to regenerate natural systems, recuperating and strengthening local and ancestral practices, within the framework of rights, obligations and responsibilities'. In relation to climate change the law has many provisions that outline the state's vision, citizens' rights, and responsibilities. It embraces the concept of 'climate justice', defined by the ability of all Bolivian citizens to 'Live Well', especially those who are most vulnerable to climate change. It reinforces the point that some states have more of a global responsibility to respond to climate change. To encourage sustainable development of natural resources, it states that climate change trajectories should be accounted for when planning and zoning responsible land use. The law focuses on reducing the risks posed by climate change through six lines of actions:The permanent incorporation of prevention of and managed response to natural disasters into the System of Integral PlanningRisk management for the agricultural sector to prevent diminished crop yields and food insecurityThe adoption of risk management of disasters as well as adaption to climate change across state development projects; development of informational networks to issue early warnings in times of natural crisis as well as to assist the agricultural industry and indigenous communities plan according to climate conditionsStrengthening territorial management processes of sub-national governments through the incorporation of risk management and adaption to climate change perspectivesArticulation between public and private scientific research sectors to share knowledge and co-ordinate research regarding vulnerabilities related to climate change The Law defines 'Living Well' in relation to climate change and lays out the state's legal obligations. The state will develop policies, strategies and legal techniques to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to them through strengthening institutional capacities for the monitoring of climate with the purpose of long-term planning. The state will also encourage the recuperation of traditional indigenous practices that were historically sustainable and allowed for the natural regeneration of resources. The law also establishes the Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth, within the Ministry of Environment and Water, as the state entity responsible for much of the development, overseeing and co-ordination of projects, programmes and research as it relates to climate change and the objectives of the Plurinational Plan for Climate Change. It also co-ordinates scientific monitoring of GHG emissions. The entity will operate within the framework of 'climate justice,' following the principles of Bolivia's climate change politics. The Authority will operate through three mechanisms: (1) Joint Mechanism of Mitigation and Adaptation for the Integral and Sustainable Management of Mother Earth's Forests; (2) Mitigation Mechanism to 'Living Well'; and (3) Adaptation Mechanism to 'Living Well'. The Authority is also responsible for the management of the Plurinational Fund of Mother Earth. The Fund will be financed with multilateral and bilateral aid, public money from the national government allocated to mitigation or adaptation, funds from private donors, national or international loans, and funds at the disposal of the executive branch.

The three main objectives of the Strategy are:improve the coherence of existing adaptation initiatives (evaluation of climate change impacts and vulnerability, existing measures)improve communication at the national, European and international levelcreate a National Adaptation Plan The Adaptation Strategy lays down the following principles and considerations to be followed during elaboration of a National Adaptation Plan (currently being developed):consideration of particular vulnerability of coastal areasneed for targeted specific adaptation measures and co-operation among all relevant stakeholderspossible side effects from adaptation measures but also potential for win-win measuresadaptation, so far a bottom-up approach, to be further encouraged and communicated through central co-ordinated initiatives especially for monitoring and best-practice sharingspecial support is to be provided to the most vulnerable groups Based on the above, the following objectives of a future National Adaptation Plan are proposed:Cluster and co-ordinate work on adaptationEnsure visibility for stakeholders, both in and outside BelgiumCreate awareness and raise the sensitivity of actorsIdentify and communicate dangers, gaps, risks, possibilities and synergiesProvide policy coherence and a clear structure in which the current activities are to be positionedProvide basis for individual actors to take preventive measures and incorporate impacts of climate change in their private, business and public planningEnable co-operation and synergy between the federal, regional and local governmentsEnsure that all levels of government can fully control an effective implementation		Belgium	BEL	Transportation	Adaptation	Adaptation	Strategy	Adaptation, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements	Flood, Drought, Change in air quality, Change in surface water, Heat waves, Storm, Erosion, Floods, Droughts, Changes in air quality, Heat waves and heat stress, Surface water change, Soil erosion, Cyclones, Tsunamis, Storms, Hurricanes, Sea level change, Changes in average temperature, Changes in average precipitation, Groundwater change	published
														1188.0		Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy	executive	The Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE)'s vision is achieving middle-income status by 2025 in a climate-resilient green economy, outlining four pillars: Agriculture: Improving crop and livestock production practices for higher food security and farmer income while reducing emissions Deforestation: Reducing emissions by protecting and re-establishing forests for their economic and ecosystem services including as carbon stocks. The National Greening Action Program derives from this goal. Power: expanding electricity generation from renewable energy for domestic and regional markets Transportation, industrial sectors and buildings: Leapfrogging to modern and energy efficient technologies. The strategy targets climate change mitigation and adaptation. It sets a target to limit 2030 emissions to 150 Mt CO2e (level of 2010 emissions), approximately 250 Mt CO2e less than in the business as usual scenario. It also establishes a target to increase generating capacity by 25,000MW by 2030 - hydro 22,000MW, geothermal 1,000MW and wind 2,000MW. There are programmes to replace wood fuel for domestic use with less polluting fuels, such as biogas. There are plans to distribute 9m stoves by 2015 and 34m by 2030. The initiative establishes a national financial mechanism called the 'CRGE Facility' to mobilise, access, sequence and blend domestic and international, public and private sources of finance to support the institutional building and implementation of the strategy. The CRGE initially relies on existing institutions, notably the Environmental Protection Authority (which in 2013 was replaced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest), the Ethiopian Development Research Institute, six ministries, and several government agencies. Subsequent phases will strengthen institutions to implement the strategy.

														1204.0		2020 Climate and Energy Package (contains Directive 2009/29/EC, Directive 2009/28/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC and Decision No. 406/2009/EC of the Parliament and the Council ; see below)	legislative	In 2007 EU leaders endorsed an integrated approach to climate and energy policy that aims to combat climate change and increase energy security while strengthening its competitiveness. In 2008 the European Commission proposed binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. This 'climate and energy package' became law in 2009. The core of the package comprises four pieces of complementary legislation. The 20-20-20 targets include: Reduction of EU GHG emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 20% of EU energy consumption to come from renewable resources by 2020 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, by improving energy efficiency The EU committed to increase its emissions reduction to 30% by 2020, on condition that other major emitting countries commit to do their fair share under a global climate agreement. Member States will limit GHG emissions between 2013 and 2020 according to a linear trajectory with binding annual targets. This will ensure a gradual move towards the 2020 targets in sectors where changes take time to implement, such as buildings, infrastructure and transportation. To increase the cost-effectiveness of policies and measures, Member States are allowed to deviate from the linear trajectory to a certain degree. The Renewable Energy Directive sets the following targets: At least 10% share of renewables in final energy consumption in the transportation sector by 2020 The biofuels and bio-liquids should contribute to a reduction of at least 35% of GHG emissions in order to be recognised. From 2017, their share in emissions savings should be increased to 50 % It further commissions an assessment of the inclusion of emissions and removals related to LULUCF - anticipated to follow up on any international agreement on forestry, deforestation and sustainability criteria. The Directive 2009/28/EC of 23 April 2009 in particular promotes the use of energy from renewable sources, amends and subsequently repeals Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.

														1413.0		Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures (Law No. 107 of 1998)	legislative	This Law is one of the two key climate laws in Japan along with the Energy Conservation Law. The purpose of the Law is to reduce emissions of GHGs derived from anthropogenic activities. GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, HFC, PFC and sulphur hexafluoride. The Council of Ministers for Global Environmental Conservation is established under the Law. The Council is chaired by the Prime Minister, and vice-chairmen are the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Minister of the Environment and Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. Other members consist of all ministers other than vice-chairmen. Designated emitters, whose workplaces contain more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent of energy annually, are mandated to develop the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasure. While there is no reduction obligation under this law, annual emission of GHGs are reported to the Minister in charge. Emission reporting under this framework equals that of the reporting under the Energy Conservation Law. This Law stipulates that the State is responsible for implementing necessary measures to introduce Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) in Japan. It adds that examination and discussion of the design and the utilization of ETS starts upon the enactment of this Law. This Law also provides that the national and local governments are responsible for development and implementation of plans to reduce GHG emissions. The National Government adopted the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures in May 2016, with the explicit aim to achieve the mid-term target set in Japan's INDC (2015) 26% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 (baseline 2013). In addition, the Plan also sets a long term goal of 80% GHG emissions reduction by 2050. Prefectural and municipal governments are also required to create local plans to reduce GHG emissions. The plans should include: Duration of the planGoalsMeasures and actions intended for implementationPromotion of solar PV, wind and other renewable energiesMeasures and actions taken by business professionals and citizens to reduce GHG emissionPromotion of public transport use, conservation of green space and other GHG emission reduction measures		Japan	JPN	Transportation,Energy	Mitigation	Mitigation	Law	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Research And Development, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation		published

The Act has set a goal of generating 35% of electricity supply from renewable energy resources by 2020 (amended from 30% after the Fukushima disaster). Longer term targets include the share of renewable electricity at 40-45% by 2025, 55-60% by 2035 and 80% by 2050. The main features of the last three amendments are specified below: The 2012 amendment (Act amending the regulatory framework for electricity from PV) introduced monthly tariff degressions in the national feed-in tariff (FiT), replacing the annual FiT cut that typically occurs in January. A EUR50m (USD62.7m) research and development programme for PV storage solutions was also established, started in January 2013. The 2014 amendment introduced four major changes:A deployment corridor for wind, photovoltaics and biomass was set in order to avoid overshoots;Direct marketing is now mandatory for all new installations (with minor exceptions);It lays the foundation for tendering of support from 2017 onwards;It removes several subsidies and exemption for energy-intensive consumers and 'prosumers'. The EEG 2017 (enters into force on 1 January 2017, full details can be found here) introduces several key new features:introduction of an auction system for nearly all renewable energy sources (onshore wind, offshore wind, photovoltaic and biomass); installations of 750kW (for biomass of 150kW) will be exempt from auctions and remunerated as previously;the already existing auction scheme for ground mounted PV solar systems will be extended to also cover rooftop plants and installations on other structures;the permitted areas for PV solar installations will now also include commercial and industrial property, areas with a plan approval decision or projects which are, subject to further requirements, located in 'disadvantaged areas';onshore wind: in 2017, 2018 and 2019, 2,800MW and from 2020, 2,900MW (gross) will be auctioned each year; andoffshore wind: up to 2030, offshore wind farms will be installed with a total capacity of 15,000 MW; the ""central 'Danish' target model"" will be introduced (the Government examines in advance the sites to be auctioned for wind farms to ensure optimal dovetailing with the grid connections and avoid a stock of grid connections having to be built and resulting in significant extra costs)."

														1207.0		Revision of the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) (Directive 2009/29/EC amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community)	legislative	A revision and strengthening of the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). A single EU-wide cap on emission allowances will apply from 2013 and will be cut annually, reducing the number of allowances for businesses to 21% below the 2005 level in 2020. The free allocation of allowances will be progressively replaced by auctioning. From 2013 the power sector will have to buy all emissions permits under an EU-wide auction (with some time-limited exceptions for newer member countries). From 2013 (phase III of EU ETS, 2013-2020), the revised ETS will be extended to new sectors (for example, aviation) or to new GHGs (besides carbon dioxide, the EU ETS also covers nitrous oxides and perfluorocarbons). Smaller emitters (<25,000 tCO2/year) may opt out of the EU ETS. By end-2009 the Commission determined the sectors or sub-sectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. Production from sectors at significant risk of carbon leakage will receive relatively more free allowances than other sectors. The revised Directive also recognises that the competitive situation, and thus the risk of carbon leakage, may change unless there is an international climate change agreement.The Directive was amended by Directive 2018/410 to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments.

														8487.0		Law no. 2017-1839 on the end of exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons and diverse dispositions related to energy and the environment	legislative	The law no. 2017-1839, voted in its final version on December 19th, 2017, and published on December 31st, 2017, modifies a number of articles from the French mining code and imposes an end to all activities of exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon fossil fuels on the French territory, including the exclusive economic zone and the continental plateau, by 2040. The ban includes gas, oil and coal, and stipulates that no further permit will be granted by the government. Permits already attributed can keep exploration and extraction activities ongoing. Permits currently being revised won't be able to seek exploitation beyond January 1st, 2040, unless the permit holder demonstrates to the administrative authority that the limited concession time does not allow to recover costs. In that case, the authority establishes modalities to take exploration and exploitation costs into account within the Conseil d'Etat decree under art. L. 132-2. Art L. 111-7 states that exploitation permit holders are still entitled to extract new substances mentioned in art. L.111-6 if the given holder can demonstrates the connexion with fuels already being extracted, and economic profitability. A derogation to the present law has been issued to allow for sulfur exploitation in the Lacq bassin to keep going. Art. L. 132-12-1. mentions that five years prior to the end of the concession, the permit holder has to send a report to the administration presenting the reconversion potential of existing installations for other ground activities, including geothermal power, or other economic activities, in particular the implementation of renewable energies.

														8262.0		Government Decision No. 1403: National Plan for Implementation of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets and for Energy Efficiency	executive	Israel's Cabinet issued decision n. 1403 on April 10, 2016 which officialises the National Plan for Implementation of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets and for Energy Efficiency. The decision exposes the numerous emissions reductions and energy efficiency targets laid out in a process that originated in Government decision n. 542 of September 2015 and how those targets shall be attained. It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets. The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million. The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period. In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Plan urges the Energy Minister, the Environmental Protection Minister, the Construction and Housing Minister, and the Finance Minister to evaluate how to update the Energy Sources Law of 1989 to establish energy ratings for new residential buildings and offices based on Israeli Standard 5282. The Housing and Energy Ministers must explain how to achieve the emissions reduction target of of 5.9 M tCO2e by 2030 in the building sector, notably by 1) increase the number of new buildings built under the country's principal green building standard, SI 5281, and 2) assess technical means. Other measures in the Plan include a confirmation of the governmental efforts to achieve a 10 % target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020, in accordance with Government Decision 4450 of January 2009.

														1513.0		Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act (amending the Climate Change Response Act 2002)	legislative	The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealands holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealands international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, most recently by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in November 2019: The Zero Carbon amendment sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Governments progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Mori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Previous amendments: The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015. The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality. The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealands emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sectors participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units. The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels.

The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand's emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units. The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.On June 22nd, 2020, the Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act was passed amend the 2002 Act. This amendment puts a cap on the existing trading scheme and aims at improving certainty for businesses, making the Emissions Trading Scheme more accessible, and improving its administration.

														4321.0		Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan	executive	In 2013, the Royal Government of Cambodia launched the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014-2023 (CCCSP) setting the vision and goals for the country to develop towards a green, low-carbon, climate-resilient, equitable, sustainable and knowledge-based economy. The CCCSP captures the main strategic objectives and directions for a climate-smart development of Cambodia in the period of ten years. It seeks to build synergies with existing government policies to ensure a strategic cohesion to address a wide range of climate change issues linked to adaptation, GHG mitigation, and low-carbon development. The eight strategic objectives defined in the document are as follows: promote climate resilience through improving food, waterand energy security; reduce vulnerability of sectors, regions, gender and health to climate change impacts; ensure climate resilience of critical ecosystems (Tonle Sap Lake, Mekong River, coastal ecosystems, highlands etc.), biodiversity, protected areas and cultural heritage sites; promote low-carbon planning and technologies to support sustainable development of the country; improve capacities, knowledge and awareness for climate change responses; promote adaptive social protection and participatory approaches in reducing loss and damage; strengthen institutions and coordination frameworks for national climate change responses; and strengthen collaboration and active participation in regional and global climate change processes. Within the scope of the strategic plans were also put in place fifteen Climate Change Action Plans (CCAP) that further detail the executive missions of ministries with regard to climate change for the period 2014-2018. The CCAPs have been outlayed by executive officials with approval from the government and been signed by the ministers in charge. The plans have explicit details about budgetary implications and associate the Ministry of Economy and Finance by explaining what budget share allocated to each ministry should be used for enforcing the plans. They deal with agriculture, forestry and fisheries; disaster management; education; gender; public health; water resource and meteorology; rural infrastructure; transport; land management, urban planning and construction; information; tourism; industry and handicraft sectors; the environment; mines and energy.

														2033.0		13th Five-Year Plan	executive	"The 13th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2016-2020 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. It gives top priority to economic development to reach a GDP growth rate of 6.5-7% per annum, consistent with the goal of becoming a 'moderately prosperous society' by 2020, guided by five key principles of 'innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development'. At the same time, the 13th Five Year Plan sets peak targets for carbon emissions and energy and water consumption, as well as goals for increasing efficiency of industries and eliminating outdated or overcapacity production facilities, increasing energy production from renewables, and developing green infrastructure. It follows the 11th Five Year Plan, which implemented the concept of energy intensity targets in a number of pilot projects, and the 12th Five Year Plan, which broadened the nature of economic growth towards social inclusiveness and sustainability. Carbon Emissions China aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18% from 2015 levels by 2020, in line with China's pledge at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where President Xi Jinping affirmed China's commitment to reduce total carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels by 2030 and peak carbon emissions by 2030. The 13th Five-Year Plan also tasks the government with developing rules and regulations to manage the national carbon trading program to be developed based on expansion of the existing seven pilot schemes and expected to be launched around 2018. Energy China aims to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 15% from 2015 levels by 2020 (compared to the 16% set in 12th Five-Year Plan 2011-2015, which eventually delivered a reduction of about 18.2%). This more conservative goal is consistent with the estimated 6.5%-7% GDP growth rate projected for 2016-2021, which is slower than the 7% growth rate targeted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. To reach this target, the 13th Five Year Plan specifies sectoral targets and milestones. First, it sets a further goal to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by at least an additional 3.4% in 2016. Second, it caps China's total energy consumption at 5 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020, a 16.3% increase in consumption from 2015 levels. To reach these goals, China's energy production mix is set to diversify and shift away from coal and towards greater proportion of renewables. China is increasing the efficiency of coal burning power plants and also plans to shut down coal-fired boilers that fail to meet national standards, and has restricted construction of new coal-fired power plants. The Plan also supports increase in renewable energy capacity and connection through national government support for wind, solar, and biomass energy production. The Government will also continue to invest in new hydropower, energy storage and nuclear power projects, as well as further increase in the network of smart grids and ultra high-voltage power transmission. Transportation The transportation measures and goals in the 13th Five Year Plan are closely related to addressing air pollution, in order to ""maintain acceptable air quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020"". The Plan aims to expand the electric vehicle market, by constructing dedicated parking lots and charging facilities, and removing almost 4 million high-emission vehicles from roads. The Plan will continue to support adoption of low-emission ""new energy vehicles"" through subsidies to automakers, local governments for purchase of green fleets, and tax breaks and free registration for consumers. REDD+ and LULUCF The 13th Five Year Plan also aims to modernize commercial agriculture production to reduce overcapacity, while aiming to turn 1 million hectares of marginal cropland into forest or grassland. In an effort to reduce air pollution, the Plan also aims to increase forest coverage to 23.04% over the next five years."

														2002.0		Law no. 2015-992 on Energy Transition for Green Growth (Energy Transition Law)	legislative	"The framework Energy Transition Law and its related action plans are designed to give France the means to diversify its energy mix and enhance its actions contributing to tackling climate change. It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious national targets:cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;cut the national energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030. The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of 14.5 euros to 56 euros per ton in 2020, and 100 euros in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget. Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194). The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy). The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26). The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66). The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educational and financial assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others. The law also promotes waste reduction and resources savings, in particular a gradual decoupling between France's growth and consumption of raw materials. The laws includes the following provisions: increase by 30% over 2010-2030, the ratio of the GDP to domestic material consumption;decrease the domestic material consumption per capita (consumer products, food waste, electronic waste) and increase recycling rates (art 70-V, art 84, art 87, art 99 and 103);the production, distribution, sale, provision and use of packaging or bags made wholly or partly from oxo-fragmentable plastic (biodegradable but not compostable) are prohibited;as of 1 January 2016, disposable plastic bags available at supermarket counters are prohibited, and from 1 January 2017, the ""fruit and vegetables"" plastic bags are prohibited (art 75);as of 1 January 2017, the use of non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic packaging for sending addressed or non-addressed press and advertising is prohibited ; state services and local authorities are to decrease their office paper consumption by 30% before 2020;as of 1 January 2017, at least 25% (40% as of 1 January 2020) of paper products, stationery and fiber-based prints acquired by state services and local authorities and their groupings are to be made from recycled paper, with the rest to come from sustainably managed forests;strengthened powers for mayors to deal with abandoned vehicles (art 77);better monitoring of waste (art 82) and fight against chemical waste trafficking (art 77-IV) and unregulated waste disposal (art 78);other quantified limits apply to State and local authorities construction work waste and raw materials use.The law also aims to support protection of biodiversity and pollution reduction, in particular through mandated reduction of free sale of pesticides for home-gardeners (from 1 January 2016) and then phase-out from 1 January 2017, and ban on aerial spraying of pesticides, except in cases of serious health hazard (art 68)."

The Framework Act requires the government to establish and implement a national strategy, action plans, and a detailed 5-year plan for a planning period of 20 years, which will deal with various aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The framework defines the main principles of a green economy, including green growth via environmental technologies and industries, and the balance between environment and economy. The Committee on Green Growth is established to deliberate on the State's major policies and plans related to low carbon green growth. Since 2013 this Committee has operated under the Prime Minister's Office. The Framework declares that the government will foster new green industries with high growth potential, by formulating means to transform traditional industries into green ones, setting targets and adapting infrastructure to an environmentally friendly structure; green investment companies shall be established and may be supported by the government; and the Framework also calls for facilitation of research, development and commercialisation of green technology. The Framework prescribes mandatory annual GHG emission reporting to the government, and the establishment of an Integrated Information Management System for GHGs. The Framework instructs the government to prepare and enforce a basic plan for energy every 5 years for a planning period of 20 years. The plan should include aspects of energy security and independence, as well as targets for energy supply from renewable sources and energy demand management via saving and efficiency. The Framework calls for the preparation of REDD/Land Use policies and transportation policies - including the establishment of standards for emissions from different classes of automobiles. It prescribes an assessment of impacts of climate change and the implementation of measures for adaptation. The Enforcement Decree is designed to provide for matters delegated by the Act and matters necessary for enforcement thereof including establishment of central and local action plans, operation of the Presidential Committee on Green Growth, establishment of and support for green industries investment companies and control of quantity of GHGs emitted and the quantity of energy consumed in each area including transportation and architecture, etc. The Decree sets a target of a reduction in total national GHG emissions in 2020 by 30% from the business-as-usual projection for 2020. Regarding transportation policies, the Decree addresses the management of the standards for corporate-average energy consumption efficiency of automobiles and compatible corporate-average allowable exhaust emissions of GHGs from automobiles. The Decree deals with the establishment of green industries investment companies. It also provides that the Minister of Environment shall establish and implement, every 5 years, measures for adaptation to climate change based on consultation with the heads of the central administrative agencies concerned.

														1602.0		Green Growth and Climate Resilience - National Strategy on Climate Change and Low Carbon Development	executive	The Strategy seeks to meet development goals while reducing the country's vulnerability through mitigation and adaptation. The key mitigation strategies are: promoting geothermal power generation, with an estimated potential of 700 MW, enough to meet all of Rwanda's demand if implemented by 2020; integrated soil fertility management, which would cut use of inorganic fertilisers, improve soil structure and the water retention capacity of soil; and high density walkable cities, fighting anticipated trends of energy-intensive urban sprawl on hilly terrain. Key adaptation elements are irrigation infrastructure, which will reduce uncertainty regarding rainfall variation; a robust road network to mitigate loss of food during transportation to markets and to ensure access during extreme weather events; the establishment of a centre for climate knowledge for development; and development of agroforestry. The strategy calls for existing programmes to be used to make quick advances - the Integrated Development Programme (IDP) to facilitate implementation of climate-resilient low-carbon development in rural areas; the National Fund for Climate and Environment (FONERWA) to facilitate access to international climate finance, especially Fast Start Finance for adaptation; implementing measuring and reporting of cross-sectoral energy use for planning and international reporting purposes; setting up an online Climate Portal to communicate the National Strategy to the public and the international community. Nine working papers have been produced: Cities and the Built Environment Sector; Water Sector; Agriculture Sector; Energy Sector; Finance Sector; Forests and Tree-based Systems Sector; Land Sector; Mining Sector; Transportation Sector.

														1573.0		Council of Ministers Resolutions 104/2006 and 1/2008, establishes and amends the National Climate Change Programme (PNAC)	executive	The PNAC 2006 contains a set of measures defined for the sectors of the economy with an impact on GHG emissions: energy (demand and supply, including the sub-sectors transport, residential and services, and industry), agriculture and livestock, forestry and waste, and thereby developed a framework of policies and measures. GHG emissions are estimated and projected up to 2010, systematised considering a reference scenario and with 'additional measures' scenario for the period 1990-2010, assumed as the average year of the period 2008-2012. The PNAC 2006 was complemented with a new set of policies and measures, through Council of Ministers' Resolution 1/2008 in order to further strengthen Portugal's commitments on key emission sources such as energy (supply and demand) and transport. Resolution 1/2008 includes: an increase to 45% of the share of electricity production from renewable sources (previously 39%); the operational start of new natural gas combined cycle power plants (2160 MW in 2006 will now be 5360 MW in 2010); and the increase of the 5.75% biofuels goal to 10% in 2010, among others. The GHG emissions reduction potential from new 2007 measures is about 1 556 kt CO2e (adopted by CME 1/2008). RCM 1/2008 also approved the ETS National Allocation Plan for the period 2008-2012 (PNALE II) and provided an update on GHG allocations by sector for each of the activities established in Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC. Order 13322/2013, of October 18, mandated the creation of the Working Group of the PNAC 2020 to monitor its development, with overall coordination left to the Environment Agency (APA, I. P.).

St. 21 (2011-2012)'. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include: 1) Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation; 2) Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity; 3) Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation; 4) Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management; 5) Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies; 6) Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues); 7) Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%; 8) Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020. The settlement includes three main targets:1) In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%2) Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 20303) By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action) While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.

														1449.0		General Law on Climate Change	legislative	The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market. Attached regulation sets the framework for the accounting of carbon emissions. The law was further amended in 2018 by Decree 13/07/2018, notably to initiate a national market of greenhouse gases emissions and to precise the contribution of Mexico within the scope of the Paris Agreement.

It aims to increase the efficiency of the public sector to improve smart 'societal planning' while retaining the competitiveness of the economy in achieving the targets without imposing new obligations on businesses or others. The act includes a planning and monitoring system and measures to clarify the climate policy planning of state authorities. This Act provides for medium and long term plans. The long term plans include the alternatives for reaching the long term emissions target and needs approval every 10 years, while the medium term plans concern measures outside the emissions trading scheme (traffic, housing, agriculture) and are to be approved once per election term and the respective government is required to report to the parliament on the implementation. The plan for adaptation stipulates a risk and vulnerability review and to be approved once every 10 years. Further the Act also provides provision for the constitution of a multidisciplinary expert body to support planning of climate policy.

It covers all CO2 storage in geological formations in the EU, and lays down requirements covering the entire lifetime of a storage site. It implements a permit regime for exploration and storage, and selection criteria for storage sites. The Directive defines the relationship between carbon, capture and storage (CCS) and the EU ETS in terms of finance and also rules that CO2 captured and stored will be considered as 'not emitted'. There are monitoring and reporting obligations, inspections, measures in case of irregularities and/or leakage and provision of financial security. Site selection is the crucial stage for ensuring the integrity of a project and the Directive lays down extensive requirements. A site can only be selected for use if a prior analysis shows that, under the proposed conditions of use, there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment. The operation of the site must be closely monitored and corrective measures taken in the case that leakage does occur. In addition, the Directive contains provisions on closure and post-closure obligations, and sets out criteria for the transfer of responsibility from the operator to the Member State.

														1196.0		2030 framework for climate and energy policies (strategic document)	executive	To ensure that the EU is on the cost-effective track towards meeting its objective of cutting emissions by at least 80% by 2050, the Commission proposed the '2030 framework for climate change and energy policies'. It was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 as a strategic document, although binding legislation is yet to be drafted. It includes the binding 2030 EU domestic GHG reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990, as well as a target of at least 27% for final renewable energy, and a at least 27% for energy savings by 2030 (target to be reviewed upwards to 30% in 2020). In addition, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. To achieve the 2030 binding 40% reduction target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005. In parallel, emissions from non-EU ETS sectors would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, through national measures. To address the surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to improve the system's resilience, a market stability reserve is to be established and the annual factor to reduce the cap on the maximum permitted emissions is to be changed from the current 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021. The volume of free allowances is to be reduced progressively; Member States with a GDP per capita below 60% of the EU average may opt to continue to give free allowances to the energy sector up to 2030, but the maximum amount handed out for free after 2020 should be no more than 40% of the allowances allocated to eligible Member States. The 2030 Framework stresses the importance of a fully functioning and connected EU energy market, as foreseen in the European Energy Security Strategy (2014). The Commission is to be supported by Member States to take measures to ensure achievement of a minimum target of 10% of electricity interconnections no later than 2020. The 2030 framework also launches the preparation of the Energy Union aiming at affordable, secure and sustainable energy, by 'pooling resources, connecting networks and uniting member states' power when negotiating with non EU countries'. Specific legislative proposals are expected in 2015.		European Union	EUR	Energy	Mitigation		Law	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand		published

														1180.0		The National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS)	executive	The National Climate Change Strategy aims to enhance the financial and institutional resources to reduce economic and social impact of climate change. The Strategy is structured around three core areas of action. To tackle losses generated by climate change, the Strategy first proposes strong participation on international climate negotiations and financial compensation to people and businesses that suffered from climate related disasters. Second, the Strategy outlines that adaptation measures should address urban and coastal changes, the recovery of critical ecosystems and rural landscapes, as well as sectoral adaptation strategies. The third focal area of the NCCS is the development of a mitigation programme that is associated with the national agenda for social and economic development, including the development of a low-carbon economy. The Inter-American Development Bank is currently supporting the implementation of the NCCS.

														1177.0		Egypt s National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management	executive	The overarching goal of this Strategy is to increase Egypt's flexibility in dealing with climate change risks and disasters as well as the Egyptian Community's 'ability to absorb, contain, and reduce such risks and disasters' across different sectors. The Strategy evaluates the current situation and risks across key sectors, in particular the intersection of coastal zones with water resources and irrigation, agriculture, health, urban areas, housing, roads, and tourism. It recommends (i) the integration of sector specific adaptation plans with each five-year plan and national development programmes; (ii) enhancing community participation and building a 'Safety First' culture; (iii) promoting regional and international co-operation; and (iv) engaging in continuous monitoring of progress. The Strategy identifies seven determinants of success in adapting to climate change risks: (i) political will at all levels, (ii) availability of human, financial, and natural resources, (iii) reform and adjustments of institutional frameworks, (iv) amendments to legislation and laws, (v) strengthening the National Information Exchange System, (vi) identification and monitoring, assessment, and follow-up of performance indicators, and (vii) development of a national model for social and economic analysis and projections. The specific framework for adaptation outlined in this Strategy is divided into four phases of execution consisting of four five-year plans. Key proposed operational measures for the first five-year plan include: developing a GIS monitoring database on coastal zones, developing a Regional Climate Model (RCM), studying the effectiveness of natural protection systems such as dunes, formulating national legislation to enable climate change risk reduction, developing additional regulations for coastal development, and enhancing partnerships between the public and private sector. Further outlines total estimated investment costs over 20 years by sector and specific operational measure. The total estimated cost across all sectors is calculated to be EGP53.07bn (USD7.4bn).

														1137.0		Act No. 75 on the Civil Defence and Decree-Law No. 170 on the System of measures of Civil Defence (Disaster-management as response to frequent extreme events)	legislative	Law No. 75 defines Civil Defence as 'a system of defensive state measures taken in peacetime during exceptional circumstances, aimed at protecting the population and the national economy from destruction by enemy or from natural disasters and other types of catastrophes, including deterioration of the environment'. When the exceptional circumstances apply, the government can use all the resources and activities of the country to respond to the needs of national defence. Decree-Law 170 then lays down the different Civil Defence measures that can be developed to help to prevent the special circumstances from occurring or minimise their impacts. It establishes the National Etat-Major of Civil Defence that co-ordinates the deployment of measures by different state organs, economic entities and social institutions in order to protect the population and the economy. Although the laws do not directly mention climate change, they lay down clear adaptation measures to extreme weather events, whose increased occurrence over the past years is recognised as part of the impact of climate change. In addition, Directive 1 of the Vice-President of the National Defence Council (2010) calls on the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment to carry out studies on the dangers, vulnerability and risk of disasters, as well as evaluation of potential climate change impacts.

														1117.0		National Plan for Climate Change Adaptation	executive	The National Plan for Climate Change Adaptation's objectives are to increase knowledge of the potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change and climate variability, to incorporate climate risk management in territorial and sectoral planning and to mitigate the climate change vulnerability of ecological and socio-economic systems. It promotes a planned, territorial environmental development compatible to Climate Change variability through sort, medium and long term actions. This Plan seeks the mainstreaming of climate variables and projections into environmental, territorial and sectoral planning, effectively decreasing the vulnerability of populations, ecosystems and productive sectors, and increasing the social, economic and ecosystems capacities to answer to climate events. The plan needs to be an instrument to establish strategic guidelines and bring effective tools to prioritise adaptations measures, as well as to guide sectors and territories in the development of strategies and adaptation plans to reduce their vulnerability and associated risks. The implementation of the plan is divided into four phases. Beginning in 2012, the first two stages were conceptual and methodological, followed by the detailing of specific sectoral and regional plans. Phase four, implementation of measures, began in 2013, while monitoring and reporting, the final phase, began in 2014.

														1094.0		National Plan on Climate Change (from Decree no 6.263)	executive	The Plan defines actions and measures aimed at mitigation and adaptation to climate change. One of the key objectives of the Plan is to keep the high share of renewable energy in the electric matrix. With this aim, it establishes a target of having more than 80% of the power base to be derived from renewable sources by 2030. The Plan also aims to: increase the share of electricity derived from wind and sugarcane bagasse plants; add a number of hydroelectric projects to the electricity network; expand the solar photovoltaic industry; promote the use of solar water heaters in the residential sector; as well as establish research on energy production from solid waste. The plan further encourages industrial users to increase their average consumption of ethanol by 11% in the next 10 years; brings forward the 5% biodiesel blending requirement from 2013 to 2010; and supports the creation of an international biofuels market. The Plan determines that a National Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be created to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by 2030 and to establish other measures such as incentives to replace old electric equipment with modern equipment, and create improvements in industry energy efficiency, transportation and buildings. The Plan promotes a sustainable increase in the use of biofuels in the national transportation network and establishes measures on adaptation to climate change. The plan establishes that actions should be taken to eliminate the loss of national forest cover by 2015. The plan sets targets for a consistent cut on deforestation to be accomplished in subsequent four-year periods. The goal is to reduce deforestation by 40% in the 2006-2009 period in relation to the Amazon Fund's 10-year reference period (1996-2005). This is followed by an additional 30% reduction in the 2010-2013 and 2014-2017 periods in relation to the previous 4-year period. These targets are to be accomplished through the provision of new and additional funding from national and international sources, including the Amazon Fund.

														9435.0		Resolution no 107/2019 of the Council of Ministers approving the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality of the Portuguese Economy in 2050	executive	This resolution approves the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality of the Portuguese Economy in 2050. This Strategy also constitutes the document being sent to the UNFCCC according to Portugal's international commitments. The document materialises the government's 2016 pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the period. The strategy explores the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifies the main vectors of decarbonisation and estimates the reduction potential of the various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport , agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater.The resolution sets as an objective, for the purposes of the previous number, the reduction of GHG emissions for Portugal between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and the compensation of the remaining emissions through the use of soil and forests, to be achieved through a emission reduction trajectory between 45% and 55% by 2030, and between 65% and 75% by 2040, in relation to 2005.The document details the following vectors of decarbonisation:a) Decarbonise the production of electricity, eliminating the production of electricity from coal by 2030 and proceeding with the total decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050, betting on endogenous renewable resources;b) Implement the energy transition, significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, investing in the incorporation of endogenous renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, promoting electrification and adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;c) Progressively decentralize and democratize energy production, giving emphasis to the role of the consumer as an active part of the energy system;d) Promote decarbonisation in the residential sector, favoring urban rehabilitation and increasing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating energy poverty;e) Decarbonise mobility, favoring the mobility system in public transport, through its strengthening and decarbonization of fleets, supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric mobility and other technologies zero emissions, together with a reduction in the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as the decarbonisation of short- and long-distance transport of goods, promoting a logistical chain with a modal split that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and fluvial transport in conjunction with rail freight;f) Promote the energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbiosis, promoting innovation and competitiveness;g) Betting on sustainable agriculture, through the significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and the use of fertilizers and promoting innovation;h) Foster carbon sequestration, through active agricultural and forest management, promoting the valorization of the territory;i) Changing the paradigm of using resources in production and consumption, abandoning the linear economic model and moving to a circular and low carbon economic model;j) Prevent the production of waste, increase recycling rates and very significantly reduce the deposition of waste in landfills;k) Streamline the participation of cities and local administrations in decarbonisation, encouraging an integrated approach to its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have been playing in mitigating climate change;l) Stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production for neutrality in the various sectors of activity;m) Make taxation an instrument for the transition to neutrality, proceeding with the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies, reinforcing the application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation on the use of resources, recycling revenues for decarbonization and fair transition ;n) Redirect financial flows to promote carbon neutrality, namely by promoting the development of a favorable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective monitoring;o) Promote the involvement of society in the transition, contributing to increase individual and collective action, the adoption of sustainable behaviors and the alteration of production and consumption patterns in favor of sustainability, namely through environmental education and awareness;p) Promote the development of skills and (re) qualification directed towards new opportunities for economic development;q) Encourage the development of the new economy linked to energy transition and decarbonisation, supporting the development of new industrial and service clusters, and the generation of new business opportunities;r) Promote a fair and cohesive transition, which values the territory, creates wealth, promotes employment and contributes to raising the standards of quality of life in Portugal.

														1721.0		Act No. 5627 on Energy Efficiency	legislative	The purpose of this Act is to increase energy efficiency, avoid waste, ease the burden of energy costs on the economy and protect the environment. It aims to do this by increasing and promoting energy efficiency in energy generation, transmission, distribution and consumption phases at industrial establishments, buildings, power generation plants, transmission and distribution networks and transportation, raising energy awareness and implementing training of citizens, and using renewable energy sources. One of the main aspects of the Act is the establishment of an administrative structure for efficient policy, monitoring, analysis, and projections of energy efficiency, through the creation of a General Directorate of Renewable Energy. The role of the General Directorate is to prepare and issue inventories and future projections for the development of energy efficiency, industrial establishments and buildings by region and sector, and annual reports containing facts and assessments for the public sector. This General Directorate also establishes and facilitates the framework for energy efficiency auditing, which is conducted on industry. The Act also sets out energy efficiency management legislation for industrial establishments, commercial buildings, service buildings or public sector buildings. It stipulates that these establishments are required to nominate one of their employees as an energy manager who will be responsible for compliance with energy efficiency legislation. An energy identity certificate is issued to building owners or managers by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. The energy identity certificate holds information on the building's energy requirements, insulation characteristics, efficiency of heating and/or cooling systems, and energy consumption, and is an important component of the energy efficiency administrative process. The Act contains a regulation that lays down principles and procedures for standardized energy performance in residential, commercial and service buildings. The regulation contains norms, standards, minimum performance criteria, data collection and control procedures on architectural design, heating, cooling, heat insulation, hot water, electrical installation and lighting. For example, buildings with a central heating system are required to use systems that allow the distribution of heating costs based on the quantity of heat consumption by central or local heat or temperature control devices. On an industry specific level, a regulation within the Act lays down the principles and procedures relating to increasing the efficiency of electric generation plants and transmission and distribution networks, demand side management, utilisation of waste heat in thermal plants, and it encourages the blending of fossil fuel distribution with fuels such as biofuel and hydrogen. Implementation of voluntary agreements with industry involves production efficiency targets, and is expected to increase energy efficiency by 10% over a three-year period. A regulation within the Act sets out stipulations on unit fuel consumption of vehicles manufactured in the country, raising efficiency standards in vehicles, rolling out mass transportation, installing advanced traffic systems for increasing energy efficiency in transportation. Training and awareness activities are considered under the Act on Energy Efficiency, which aims to promote effectiveness of energy efficiency services and energy awareness. Activities are focused across producers, importers, and consumers, with practical and theoretical information available for all stakeholders.

The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register. The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2. The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS. The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account. During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction. Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established. The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers. Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy.

														1636.0		Renewable Energy Act (Act 309/2009 on Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources and High-efficiency Cogeneration and on amendments to certain acts)	legislative	The Act is the main instrument to support renewable electricity generation. It defines specific options for support for renewable electricity, including the timeframe of guaranteed price of purchase. It also originally mandated electricity producers with capacity of 50MW to produce electricity with minimum of 20% share of renewable resources. Due to its generous feed-in tariffs for solar energy, Slovakia witnessed an unanticipated 'solar boom' in early 2011. As a result, in February 2011, the size of the solar installations eligible for these subsidies was scaled back to 100kW, and feed-in tariffs were nearly halved compared to 2009. In August 2012, another amendment changed the conditions for producers of electricity from small solar rooftop installations with installed capacities of up to 10 kW. Operators of these installations may now generate electricity for their own use without having to register as an entrepreneur. According to a 2013 amendment, the feed-in tariff will apply only to rooftop photovoltaic installations on with a maximum capacity of 30kW. All larger installations are no longer be covered by the support mechanism. The initial version of the amendment also envisaged promoting high efficiency cogeneration up to an installed capacity of 300MW, but it was eventually revoked. Feed-in tariffs are limited to installations producing electricity from renewable energy sources or CHP with installed power up to 5MW (15MW in the case of wind power). The feed-in tariff and other support are provided to electricity producers during 15 years since the commissioning of the installation or its renovation (conditions apply). The Act also specifies the quotas for increase in share of biofuels in the transport fuels for individual years between 2011 and 2020. The share of biofuels should reach 8.5% by the end of 2020. The Law mandates the Ministry of Economy to set the national target for share of energy from renewable sources in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. The national target has been set at 14% of final energy consumption. The sectoral targets of share of renewable energy are 24% in electricity production, 14.6% in heating and cooling, and 10% in transport.

														1385.0		National Energy Strategy (Interministerial Decree of 8 March 2013)	executive	The National Energy Strategy (NES), which has a double time horizon (2020 and 2050), directs efforts towards substantially improving the competitiveness of the energy system and environmental sustainability. The results expected by 2020 are:1) Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).2) Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources. 3) Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).4) GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.5) Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures. To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:1) Fostering Energy Efficiency2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario		Italy	ITA	Transportation,Industry,Energy,Residential and Commercial		Mitigation	Decree/Order/Ordinance, Strategy	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Research And Development, Energy Supply, Energy Demand		published

														8664.0		Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030	executive	This White Paper is a complete energy policy update, which sets out a framework to guide policy between now and 2030. Its objective is to guide a transition to a low carbon energy system, which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to our citizens and businesses. Ireland's energy policy addresses three core objectives: sustainability, security of supply, and competitiveness. It also addresses the need for affordable energy for domestic and business consumers. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050, and will fall to zero or below by 2100. Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target is to increase the share of national energy consumption made up of renewable energy sources (RES) to 16%. This target is broken into three key sectors with individual targets for each sector: 40% of electricity supply (RES-E), 12% of heating (RES-H), and 10% of transport (RES-T). Ireland also has a target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. Renewable energy and improved energy efficiency will play vital roles in reducing emissions. Decisions about the development and deployment of new technologies will inform the renewable energy mix and impact on the role of citizens as energy consumers. By 2030, the Better Energy Programme will deliver enough deep energy efficiency upgrades to put the residential sector on a realistic trajectory to a low carbon energy future. Consumers will drive the transition by, for example, choosing to use less energy, adopting lower carbon options for transport and heating shifting energy use to o -peak times or investing in smart home technologies.Stable, transparent, evidence-based, and independent regulation is essential to facilitate competition, to support investment, and to ensure that the cost of capital and network costs are minimised. The SEM is in the process of being reformed and regulators are working to implement the new I-SEM market by 2017. Integration between the SEM and its neighbouring electricity markets will gradually deepen.

														1280.0		National Energy Policy	executive	Grenada's National Energy Policy (GNEP) lays down the Government's objectives for shaping the energy sector in Grenada, in order to 'ensure access to affordable, equitable, and reliable energy sources and services to drive and secure national development, and to improve the quality of life for all of its citizens'. The GNEP is based on seven core principles:1) Energy Security;2) Energy Independence;3) Energy Efficiency;4) Energy Conservation;5) Environmental Sustainability;6) Sustainable Resource Exploitation;7) Rational Energy Prices; and8) Energy Equity and Solidarity, including with future generations. The GNEP further calls for a minimum of a 20% reduction of GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion below 'Business As Usual' by 2020, and it sets a specific target for renewable energy: to provide 20% of all domestic energy used for electricity and transport by 2020. It also calls for the implementation of various measures to encourage energy efficiency and conservation in energy generation, transport and buildings sectors although it does not include specific targets. In particular, the GNEP calls for a set of specific projects to be co-ordinated by the Government by 2020: 1) Complete feasibility and construct a 20MW geothermal plant 2) Construct an additional 20MW geothermal plant 3) Construct a 2.5MW wind turbine for Carriacou 4) Achieve 10% electricity generation by wind & solar PV 5) Establish vehicle fuel efficiency standards 6) Achieve 20% market penetration with hybrid and electric vehicles. It also demands the establishment of the necessary international structures, including a National Energy Commission representing relevant stakeholders that would 'review the achievement of the policy targets, receive comments from stakeholders (&) and feed this information back to government, recommending solutions where necessary'. Finally, it offers a layout of a 10-year Grenada Energy Development Strategy (2010-2020), which provides for adoption of energy specific legislation such as Energy Efficiency Act, Geothermal Bill, and revision of the Electricity Supply Act. The proposed Energy Efficiency Act includes the following provisions:1) Mandate commercial building planning regulations(e.g. mandatory renewable sources contribution to energy consumption for new buildings);2) Require the use of energy efficiency standards and building codes for ventilation, cooling, water- and process-heating, lighting and in institutional, commercial and industrial buildings;3) Require all government buildings of a certain size to have periodic energy audits and compliance audits;4) Mandate the compilation and publication of sectoral benchmarking data (e.g., kWh per hotel room-night for the hotels sector);5) Require commercial banks to provide financial incentives for investments in energy efficiency to businesses and homeowners;6) Mandate specified fuel efficiencies for imported vehicles;7) Require training in 'eco-driving' practices for public and private sector organisations;8) Develop, monitor, publish and update indicators of national energy consumption and efficiency. As of August 2014, the government had not passed legislation to make the measures outlined in the GNEP legally binding, but it is currently drafting a concession law for the exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources.

It introduces a pricing system for each MWh produced by different RES (onshore and offshore wind power, photovoltaic systems, hydroelectric power, solar power, geothermal energy and biomass. Under this law, producers of electricity (supplying buildings) from RES are exempt from the special duty (article 25 of L3468/2006) in order to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and to make renewables more attractive to producers and consumers. A technical study on environmental and financial feasibility of installing alternative systems for energy supply for all new buildings is required to be submitted to the competent authorities. The law simplifies the licensing procedure, improving the feed-in-tariff scheme (in particular for wind and solar power), reducing existing barriers at local level, and setting out specific regulations for the use of RES in buildings. The law also expands the scope of L3661/2008 ('Measures for the reduction of energy consumption in buildings'). According to the present law, all new buildings that apply for construction licence after 1 January 2011 must have a solar energy water?heating system. In addition, the total energy consumption needs in all new buildings should be met by RES systems by 31 December 2019; for public sector buildings this obligation should be met by 31 December 2014. Finally, to achieve the national target of 20% share of renewable energy in final energy consumption, the law establishes a 40% RES in electricity production target, 20% RES in heating and cooling target, and 10% RES in transport target.

														1356.0		Six Five-Year National Development Plan Law and Fifth Five-Year National Development Plan - FYDP (2010-2015)	executive	The 5th FYDP (2010-2015) adopted an environmental assessment of strategic policies and plans as well as an ecosystem-based approach to the management of wetlands and biodiversity. It also incorporated climate change considerations. In order to reduce the country's dependence on oil and gas and diversify energy supply, the 5th FYDP calls for the optimisation of production and an increase in power plant efficiency, reducing waste and development of Combined Heat and Power. With this objective, affiliated companies are required: (i) to subsidise the purchase of electricity from dispersed small-scale electricity producers through long-term contracts and to convert 12,000MW to gas; (ii) to guarantee long-term contracts to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy sources and clean energy; and (iii) support the development of small-scale power plants that generate electricity by the private sector and co-operative companies. In order to save energy, and support and encourage consumers to use less energy, maintain energy reserves and protect the environment, the Ministries of Energy, Petroleum and Industry and Mine can apply financial incentives to optimise energy consumption, and encourage production of energy-saving products with high quality. Organisations and companies that reduce their emissions under the International frameworks, such as the Clean Development mechanisms, are permitted to trade or sell their CERs. In order to create an infrastructure for wind farms and solar manufacturing equipment and the development of clean energy usage, the government is entitled to the protection of private and cooperative sectors through managed funds and interest subsidy facility, producing up to five thousand megawatts of wind and solar energy. The state is obliged to modify the patterns of exploitation of forests, rangelands, water and soil through (i) use renewable energy instead of firewood; (ii) promote agricultural development and intensification of the fight against timber trafficking and wood products, forest and pasture, and cut tariffs on imports of wood; (iii) support livestock production; (iv) build in forest areas according to relevant laws and regulations; (v) increase forest land and implement watershed operations up to 8m hectares by the end of the fifth FYDP; (vi) implement desertification operations and crisis control centres. In order to retrofit buildings and modify energy consumption patterns in buildings and housing, municipalities are required to comply with the National Building Regulations. The Department of Environmental Protection is required to take necessary measures to reduce air pollution to international standards, including the promotion of GHG mitigation policies.The 6th FYDP law of 2017 updates the objectives set out in the previous plan. It aims in article 50 at increasing the share of renewable and other clean sources to at least 5 per cent of the capacity by 2021.

														1528.0		National Climate Change Policy	executive	The Policy identifies vulnerabilities to climate change in the sectors of water resources, agriculture, forestry, coastal areas, biodiversity and vulnerable ecosystems and spells out the appropriate adaptation measures to be adopted. It also puts forward appropriate measures concerning disaster preparedness, capacity building, institutional strengthening, technology transfer and international cooperation. The Policy provides a comprehensive framework for the National Action Plan for adaptation and mitigation. The objectives of the new policy are to pursue sustainable economic growth with a series of measures that appropriately address the challenges of climate change. These measures should integrate climate change policy with interrelated national policies. It is intended that policies should focus on pro-poor and gender-sensitive adaptation while also promoting mitigation. There is an explicit acknowledgement of the risks posed to water, food and energy security posed by climate change; and the need to minimise the risks from the increased frequency and intensity of events like floods and droughts. The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability. All relevant ministries, departments and agencies will have to devise their own plans and programmes to implement policy provisions relating to their sectors. Similarly, the lower levels of government, provincial governments; the regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan; federally administrated territories and local governments are expected to establish their own strategies, plans and programmes for NCCP implementation.

														2005.0		Energy Law (Dz.U. 1997 nr 54 poz. 348)	legislative	This law (with later amendments, lastly in September 2015) defines the principles of state energy policy, conditions for the supply and use of fuels and energy, and the framework for activities of energy companies. It also specifies the authorities responsible for the management of fuels and energy. Among others, it established the basis for independent electricity and gas production and access of independent power producers to the grid, principles for least cost and integrated resource planning, support to high efficiency heat and power production, demand side management and energy efficiency labels. It facilities the production of electricity from renewable energy sources (up to 5MW), making them eligible to benefit from a reduced grid connection fee and exempt from paying annual licence fees. Energy providers are allowed to incorporate costs of developing renewable energy into their tariff regimes. Since 1 October 2005, energy enterprises that generate, trade or purchase electricity are obliged to purchase or generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources of energy. The obligation will be met through the acquisition and redemption of certificates of origin that certify electricity produced from renewable sources. Transmissions and distribution operators are obliged to accept renewable sources of energy. Similar scheme for heat produced from renewable energy sources entered into force on 1 January 2007. The amendment of 26 July of 2013 simplified the setting up a micro-installation (renewable energy sources with no more than 40kW of total installed electrical capacity, connected to electrical grid of a voltage lower than 110kV or no more than 120 kW of total installed heat capacity). Applications to connect a micro-installation to the grid will no longer be subject to a connection fee nor required to attach documents confirming the admissibility of locating the installation in the investment area. In some cases, there will be no need for an interconnection agreement. It also expands the definition of renewable energy sources to aerothermal and hydrothermal, it provides the protection of vulnerable consumers, as well as support for energy-intensive industries. In order to make the gas market more transparent and competitive, the Small Tri-Pack imposes the obligation to sell at least 30% (40% since 2014 and 55% since 2015) of the gas at the exchange markets. The Act also exempts people producing energy from renewable resources for their own purposes from the obligation to obtain the license for the power supply. The amendment to the Energy Law from 26 September 2015 introduces measures necessary for the application of the 'REMIT Regulation' of the European Parliament and the Council Regulation no. 1227/2011 (25 October 2011) on the wholesale energy market integrity and transparency.

														1693.0		Energy Act 730.0 and related regulation	legislative	"The Energy Act (as amended notably by the 2007 Electricity Supply Act, in force since 01/01/2009) and related Ordinances (see below) provide the basis for a 'sustainable and modern Swiss energy policy' (Swiss Federal Office of Energy). The main aim of the Act is to contribute to an adequate energy supply - i.e. diversified, safe, economical and compatible with the requirements of environmental protection. Its principal goals include: - ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection - promote the efficient and rational use of energy - encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy. The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders: - The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM). - The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000 - Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009). Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances. The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act: It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006. The overall funding for available feed-in tariffs is capped in 2015 at approximately CHF580m (USD605.9m), with funds to be distributed among the different types of technologies so as to ensure their parallel development (the entire fund cannot assigned to one single technology). The making of the New Energy Act started on September 30, 2016, to enhance its previously stated goals over the period until 2035 of a sustainable security of supply, efficiency, reduced overall energy consumption and increase of domestic renewable energy use. The referendum of May 21st, 2017, decided for a ""complete revision"" of the Act that will enter into force on January 1, 2018. Revisions under the new Act include an increased promotion of renewables, which will benefit of a grid fee raised to 2,3 ct./kWh. However, the new system of subsidies is limited to the end of 2022 and plants under 1 MW of capacity won't be accepted anymore. Smart metering systems also get enhanced legal rights. Energy efficiency targets for private motorised vehicles (cars) are indexed to the European Union limits, and subsidies will be included for vehicles emitting less than 50g of CO2 per km will be applied from 2020 to 2022. Furthermore, a complete ban to any further project of nuclear energy is stated. An ""Energy Strategy 2050"" document has also been released as an official vision of where the country is aiming to."

														1592.0		Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation	executive	The Doctrine has a declarational nature, sets strategic guidelines and serves as a foundation for the development and implementation of future climate policy, covering issues related to climate change and its consequences. It is not a binding bill. The Doctrine is based on fundamental and applied scientific knowledge, including various studies carried out within the Russian Federation, and is a political document recognising the challenges and issues surrounding climate change. The Doctrine will serve as a blueprint to harmonise domestic climate-related legislation with international standards, improve climate monitoring, stimulate the adoption of stronger environmental standards, the adoption of energy-efficiency and energy-saving measures, as well as greater use of alternative (including renewable) energy sources. It underlines three areas for future climate policy: improving research to better understand the climate system and assess future impacts and risks; developing and implementing short- and long-term measures for mitigation and adaption; and engagement with the international community. Participation in international efforts is recognised as crucial for a long-term solution to climate problems. Putting a price on carbon: Participation in international mechanisms facilitating the reduction of GHG emissions constitutes one of the most important priorities of Russian climate policy. Energy - supply-side policies: Russia will aim to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently) while doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants. It will also limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells, and increase the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to: 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020. Energy - demand-side policies: Russia will develop and implement measures to enhance energy efficiency across the economy and expand the use of renewable and alternative energy sources. Mainstreaming climate change: Climate policy will be implemented on the basis of action plans, at a federal, regional and sectoral level. Federal authorities will be responsible for fiscal and financial incentives for technology development and deployment, including energy-efficient and energy-saving technologies as well as renewable energy technologies, across various industrial and other sectors. It will also be responsible for developing a national GHG inventory along with regional authorities. Enterprises will be responsible for implementing measures to improve the energy efficiency of thermal and electric power, vehicles, buildings and facilities. They will also implement measures to increase the share of alternative (including non-carbon) energy sources. Objective coverage of the problems connected with climate change and its consequences, including climate change outreach programmes (including in mass media), is among the priorities of climate policy. 'Anticipatory adaptation to climatic change consequences is among the priorities of the Russian Federation climate policy& Climate change adaptation measures are regulated by state authorities' decisions, including decisions related to interaction of the Russian Federation with the international community.'

														1499.0		Energy Report	executive	This document is prepared by the government every four years to establish energy and climate policies. In 2011, the government presented the latest version of the Energy Report, which outlined the ambition to become more sustainable in energy and less dependent on fossil fuels in the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050. As presented in this report, the three pillars of the Dutch energy strategy are to ensure reliable energy supply at competitive prices and green growth as primary economic objectives, while maintaining an international approach in the long-term transition to a sustainable energy supply. To expand the share of renewable energy, the government proposes a two-track policy. The long-term approach aims to make renewable energy competitive with grey energy. The short term approach aims to achieve the European target for renewable energy in the Netherlands of 14% in 2020. This target should be achieved by using for instruments: Sustainable Energy Incentive Scheme Plus (SDE+); obligation for use of biofuels in the transport sector; co-firing with biomass in coal-fired power stations; and import of renewable energy. The document sees the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) as the most important instrument for reducing carbon emissions. It acknowledges the need to improve the investment climate by reducing the regulatory burden and by facilitating more efficient control. This will involve an evaluation into the Electricity Act 1998 and the Gas Act, to assess the scope for deregulation, reduction of control costs and the administrative burden and the costs associated with compliance.

Directive 2004/101/EC reinforces the link between the EU's emission allowance trading scheme and the Kyoto Protocol by making the latter's 'project-based' mechanisms (Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism) compatible with the scheme. From 2005, all installations in the energy sector, iron and steel production and processing, the mineral industry, and the wood pulp, paper and board industry, and emitting the specific GHG associated with that activity, must possess a permit issued by the appropriate authorities. Each Member State must draw up a national plan indicating the allowances it intends to allocate for the relevant period and how it proposes to allocate them to each installation. The Directive also provides for flights that arrive or depart from a Member State's territory to be subject to the EU ETS (from 2012), measure that so far applies to intra-EU flights. Any operator failing to surrender the quantity of allowances commensurate with the emissions from his/her installation during the previous year will have to pay EUR100 (USD 125) per tCO2e and buy allowances for the excess emissions. The 2003 Directive was amended by Directive 2004/101/EC, Directive 2008/101/EC, Regulation (EC) No 219/2009, Directive 2009/29/EC, Decision No 1359/2013/EU, Commission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013, Regulation (EU) No 421/2014 and Regulation (EC) 2017/2392.

														1118.0		Colombian Low-Carbon Development Strategy	executive	The Colombian Low-Carbon Development Strategy (ECDBC) was launched in February 2012 as a tool to deliver the objectives of the National Development Plan 2011-2014 and the CONPES Document on Climate Change by promoting efficient low-carbon growth. It foresees the identification of a GHG emissions baseline and the formulation and implementation of low-carbon development plans for the sectors of energy, mining, agriculture, transportation, industry, waste and construction. On the basis of these results appropriate NAMAs and projects will be put in place. With the support of the EU, the UK and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, UNDP will contribute to the implementation of the Strategy by providing information for the development of emissions baselines and of cost-effective action plans and public policies. It will also strengthen the capacity of the ministries to integrate low-carbon aspects into their activities. The LCDS seeks to explore ways in which Colombia can contribute to the challenge of mitigating global climate change, while adapting to the impacts of changing climatic conditions domestically. Colombia sees potential co-benefits in terms of the LCDS contributing to economic, social and environmental goals. For instance, in terms of economic competitiveness it sees potential gains by increasing energy efficiency and hence production costs. Planning documents publicly available on the LCDS refer to the development of working groups to examine the potential mitigation and adaptation benefits in each sector of the economy, in addition to production of sector-specific abatement curves.

														1107.0		Energy Efficiency Act (repeals the Law on Energy Efficiency 2004)	legislative	This Act, implementing EU energy efficiency directives, lays down the foundations of the energy efficiency policy. It aims to promote energy efficiency through a system of measures for enhancing security of energy supply, competition in the energy sector and environment protection. It also mandates the Council of Ministers to submit the National Energy Efficiency Strategy to the National Assembly for adoption and elaborates regularly National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency. The most recent plan included national indicative targets for energy savings by 2016 of at least 9% of final energy consumption for 9 years (average 1% per year), to be achieved thanks to obligation to adopt municipal energy efficiency programmes, requirements for energy efficiency labelling, use of minimum standards for energy efficient appliances, energy efficiency labelling, obligatory audits and amendments of the Energy Performance Standards for existing buildings. The Minister of Economy and Energy is responsible for implementing policy on energy efficiency improvement. The Act further provides for: energy efficiency improvement activities and measures and provision of energy services; creation of a national information system for ensuring accessibility and availability of information on the condition of energy efficiency; funding mechanisms for energy efficiency improvement and energy savings certificates; energy efficiency control; and administrative penalty provisions. It creates the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Sources Fund, with the income mainly raised from grants from international financial institutions, international funds, Bulgarian and foreign natural or legal persons, with a mandate to support a broad range of investments, with priority funding for 'a) implementation of measures to increase energy efficiency in end-use; b) use of renewable energy in final energy consumption'. The Act also introduces Energy Service Companies and proposes specific activities and measures for improving energy efficiency and energy services (introduced by amendments in 2013), such as 'certification for energy efficiency of new buildings; inspection and certification for energy efficiency of buildings in operation; survey of industrial systems; inspection for energy efficiency of heating systems with boilers and air conditioning systems in buildings; managing energy efficiency; and improvement of the energy performance of the outdoor lighting'.

														1103.0		Energy from Renewable Sources Act	legislative	The Energy from Renewable Sources Act replaces the Renewable and Alternative Energy Sources and Biofuels Act (2008), which was the first national legislation entirely dedicated to the renewable energy sources, mainly introducing the requirements of the related EU directives. The 2008 Act established support mechanisms that provided for 'equal preferential treatment for producers of electricity (green certificates); mandatory inclusion of utilities generating electricity from RES and biofuels into the national grid; establishing preferential prices for purchasing energy generated from RES (feed-in tariffs); and reducing the administrative burden on producers. The Act resulted in a rapid development of RES (wind and photovoltaic), which put upward pressure on electricity prices. As a result in June 2011 the Parliament adopted the Energy from Renewable Sources Act. The new legislation kept RES preferential treatment options but introduced a preference for energy from biomass and shifted the balance of power from RES producers to grid operators and allowed for a substantial reduction of the prices of energy from photovoltaic (PV)'.

It is spilt into two parts. The Strategy describes the goals, challenges and fields of action in adapting to climate change in Switzerland. The overall goal of the strategy is to seize the opportunities provided by climate change, to minimise climate change related risks and to improve the adaptive capacity of society, the environment and the economy. The first part examines the climate change impacts and identifies the most important fields of action of adaptation to climate change in the following sectors: - Natural hazard management - Water management - Agriculture - Forestry - Energy - Tourism - Biodiversity management - Health - Spatial development. The second part of the strategy is an action plan to reach the strategy's goals. These measures are co-ordinated between the federal offices in order to address the challenges posed by climate change, i.e., effects of heat waves in urban areas, droughts, floods, increasing slope instabilities in the Alps, decreasing snow cover, adverse effects on water, soil and air quality, changes in biodiversity, and the potential spreading of invasive species, vermin and infectious diseases. The adaptation measures need to be carefully aligned with other cross-cutting strategies of the Federal Council. 12 cross-sectoral challenges are identified, including: - Greater heat stress on agglomerations and cities - Increasing levels of summer drought - Greater risk of flooding - Decreasing slope stability and more frequent mass wasting - Rising snowline - Impaired water, soil and air quality - Change in habitats, species, composition and landscapes - Spread of harmful organisms, diseases and alien species. Co-ordinated approach includes the following: - Working with the cantons, cities and municipalities - In the context of sectoral policies - Cross-collaboration and coordination - International cooperation on adaptation to climate change -International climate negotiations - Adapting to climate change in Europe - Collaboration with neighbouring countries.

														1777.0		Clean Air Act	legislative	The Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to control air pollution on a national level. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare. Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes: - National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation) - State Implementation Plans (SIPs) - New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) - National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above. Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect. The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established, and the EPA is currently promulgating standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and has announced plans to regulate GHG emissions from additional stationary sources.

														1038.0		National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007	legislative	The Act establishes the legislative framework for the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme. The goal of the NGER Act was to introduce a single national reporting framework for the reporting and dissemi-nation of information related to GHG emissions, GHG projects, energy consumption and energy production of corporations. The NGER Act was in part designed to underpin the introduction of a future emissions trading scheme. Additionally, the NGER Act is intended to meet international GHG reporting obligations, and reduce red tape and duplication associated with emissions reporting. The NGER Act sets out a number of thresholds in relation to GHG emissions, energy production and energy consumption. Corporations that meet an annual NGER threshold must register with the Clean Energy Regulator, and submit annual reports of GHG emissions, energy production, energy consumption, and other information. The annual reports cover the financial year (1 July to 30 June). All registered corporations are required to submit a report, even where the threshold has not been met in a given reporting year. Failure to submit reports on time can attract penalties. If the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2] passes into law, the Act may be amended to require the Minister to cause to be conducted reviews of the operation of the Act and legislative instruments under the Act.

														1072.0		Special Act to reform the finance of the Communities and the Regions, the extension of the tax autonomy of the Regions and the finance of new competences	legislative	The Act establishes a mechanism to incentivise climate action as part of the National Climate Strategy and contributes to reaching European and International objectives. It Is based on a multiannual reference trajectory for GHG emissions reduction in the residential and tertiary building sectors (excluding industrial buildings), specific for each region. A financial bonus is attributed to a region when it exceeds its assigned objective, to be invested in emission reduction policies. If a region fails to meet its assigned objective, a financial penalty is foreseen, calculated on the difference between the reference trajectory and actual emissions, to be invested in emission reduction policies by the national government. This mechanism is to be financed with revenues from auctioning of the emission quotas assigned to Belgium (which are yet to be distributed between the regions and the national government through the domestic-burden sharing, currently being discussed). In order to ensure that a sufficient part of the auctioning revenues is preserved, a bonus ceiling is set at a level equal to the national government's share of auctioning revenues, while the penalties ceiling is set at 50% of the regional share of the auctioning revenues.

														1295.0		National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for 2010-2020	executive	This action plan constitutes the basis for action on resource efficiency and sustainability. The strategic objective of the EU stipulates a 13% increase in renewable energy capacity by 2020. The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005. The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport. The NREAP provides that the following will be financed: green economy development, research and development, adaptation to use of green electricity, biofuel benefits, tariffs and tax issues. It also aims to formulate incentives through regulatory and comprehensive programmes on sustainable energy management, renewable energy, simplification of authorisation procedures, establishment of regional energy agencies, and review of energy certification procedures for buildings. Social measures such as employment, national and regional training, social awareness-raising and network of energy experts are among the planned measures outlined in the action plan. Specific laws and programmes in question and associated details are included at the end of the NREAP.

														1113.0		Energy Efficiency Act (S.C. 1992, c. 36)	legislative	The Act aims to establish minimum energy efficiency standards for a broad range of products and equipment in order to decrease overall Canadian energy consumption. It gives the government of Canada the authority to make and enforce standards for the performance of energy-consuming products that are imported into Canada, or that are manufactured in Canada and shipped across provincial or territorial borders. The Act also gives the federal government the authority to set labelling requirements for these products so consumers can compare the energy efficiency of various models of the same product. The Energy Efficiency Regulations 2016 came into effect on 28 June 2017 and repealed and replaced the existing Energy Efficiency Regulations made under the Energy Efficiency Act. There are several monitoring arrangements that govern the Act. A database will be used to identify the amount of energy that can be saved for specific products. It will also help in compiling statistics on energy consumption as well as develop alternative energy sources Importing into Canada, or trading between provinces, products that do not meet such energy efficiency standards, or tampering with an energy efficiency label, is a criminal offence.

														1116.0		Law 1715/2014, regulating the integration and promotion of non-conventional renewable energy (FNCER)	legislative	The Law 1715/2014 aims to promote the development and use of non-conventional energy sources, mainly renewable energy sources, in the national energy system, by integrating them into the electricity market and in other energy uses. The Law seeks to promote efficient energy management, which comprises both energy efficiency and demand response. The Law establishes the legal framework and mechanisms to promote the use of non-conventional energy sources, and to foster investment, research and development of clean energy technologies. It seeks to set lines of action to comply with commitments made with regard to renewable energy, efficient energy management and GHG reduction, such as those acquired by approving the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Law allows the release of surplus energy into the network for all self-generators. Surplus energy of small self-generators that use FNCER is recognised as energy credits, which can be negotiated according to regulations issued by the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission. The Law introduces a new classification for self-generators: small and large scale, but only in reference to the form of energy delivery that is classified as small scale by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit. This Law also allows small scale FNCER auto-generators to use bi-directional meters to be able to balance their consumption and deliveries to the grid; simple connection and surplus delivery procedures are to be put in place to enable such mechanisms to be implemented by residential users (Art 8.b). Distributed generation is also an important modification of the electricity sector. The new Law allows a generator close to consumption centres and connected to a Local Distribution System to deliver energy directly to consumers. Incentives for FNCER include those related to: (i) tax, through deductions on the investment income statement related to these purposes; (ii) tariffs, through the exemption from payment of import duties on machinery and equipment for this type of generation; and (iii) accounting, where an accelerated depreciation on assets is permitted. The Law provides for the establishment of a Non-Conventional Energy and Efficient Energy Management Fund (FENOGE), which may finance all or part of the programmes and projects for the residential sector, at levels 1, 2 and 3, as long as they involve small scale, self-generation solutions and promote energy efficiency and good practice. On September 16th, 2017, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued decree n. 1543 that modifies the rules established by decree n. 1073/2015 and further details the scope, organisation and financial means of FENOGE. UPME and CREG are responsible for issuing regulations applicable to FNCER, establishing new self-generation schemes, and setting price signals. The Law provides the government 12 months to issue such regulations.

														1359.0		The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) - 4th version 2017-2020	executive	Ireland's third NEAAP sets out the energy efficiency measures by sector in Ireland that will contribute towards the national energy efficiency 2020 target. The NEAAP identifies a number of measures which can lead to a reduction in annual emissions of around 7.3Mt, representing an estimated energy saving of 31,955GWh. The NEAAP confirms Ireland's commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 and to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use. These constitute the central pillars of Ireland's national energy efficiency policy. The 2014 NEAAP acknowledges that the substantial savings in the last three years. The key message from these figures is that Ireland has achieved 12,337GWh (primary energy equivalent) by end-2012, which represents 39% of the national target. Progress is also steady with respect to the 33% target set for the public sector. Nevertheless, the mix of energy policy measures across the various sectors of the economy will be kept under constant review and adapted as necessary to ensure they are contributing the energy savings required to meet the 2020 objectives.

														1132.0		Regulations on the Efficient Use of Energy (Law No. 7447)	legislative	This law consolidates the participation of the State in the promotion and gradual execution of the programme for the efficient use of energy. It also attempts to establish mechanisms to achieve energy efficiency, taking environmental protection into account. The Ministry for Natural Resources and Energy is responsible for the implementation, monitoring the 'National Programme for the Rational Use of Energy'. To promote this objective, the law establishes the obligation to execute energy efficiency programmes of rational use of energy in companies with high consumption levels. Companies have the legal obligation to report the precise amount of energy they use. When the amount is beyond the maximum level allowed by the Ministry, businesses are notified and have three months to submit a plan to reduce their energy consumption, within six months. The government can, in certain circumstances, provide specific technical recommendations to these companies. The Law calls for the creation of campaigns to raise public awareness on the rational use of energy, including educational programmes in schools. All products must publicly announce their level of energy consumption. Producers of machines and/or vehicles that use energy (of any source) must obtain authorisation from the Ministry relating to their energy efficiency before beginning production of these goods. The import of similar equipment (including vehicles) is conditional on the submission of energy efficiency data. The law determines that the Ministry for Natural Resources, Energy and Mining is in charge of determining limits for emissions from vehicles, to be monitored and controlled by the Ministry of Transport. Additionally, it exempts equipment used for renewable energy from import duties and provides for other tax exemptions (excise tax, ad valorem tax, general sales tax, specific customs tax). Fines and penalties apply upon breaching the law. Additional legislative and executive regulation specifies mechanisms of support for clean technologies and rational use of energy. Those include an Executive Decree reforming the incentives system for the use of hybrid electrical vehicles; a modification of the law to provide tax exemption for equipment and certain materials, imported as well as produced domestically that contribute to energy savings and rational use; a decree that establishes new rules of the Bandera Azul Ecológica'certification programme for climate-friendly communities and private housing (energy efficiency, low GHG emissions, etc.); and a directive that requires the energy and telecommunications sectors to adopt administrative, financial, legal and technical measuresto ensure citizens' access to cleaner energies at the least possible cost.

														1141.0		Act No. 165/2012 Coll. on supported energy sources and on amendment to some laws	legislative	The Act contains measures to slow-down the further development of energy from renewable sources while still meeting the EU targets for renewable energy under the burden sharing agreement in compliance with the Renewable Energy Directive. The objective is to minimise consumer prices and guarantee a long-term sustainable development of renewable energy sources. It regulates the guarantees of origin for energy from renewable sources, funds to support the market competitiveness of energies from renewable sources by granting subsidies to operators to bridge the cost difference, levy on electricity from solar/PV, and creates market conditions for achieving the national targets on energy from renewable sources under the consideration of customer interests to minimise the economic impacts of support for renewable energies on energy prices. However, the 2013 amendment to the Act limits state support to renewable energy sources to installations commissioned before 31 January 2013 (hydropower generation facilities with capacity up to 10 MW exempt). The Act further introduces a tax levy on subsidised solar power production. Initially (2011) equal to 26% of the feed-in tariff for operators of new installations in operation after 1 January 2009 (exception of rooftop installations up to 30kW), it has been reduced to 10% of the feed-in tariff or 11% of the green bonus received (starting January 2014 and limited to installations commissioned between January-December 2010). Installations with capacity under 30kW are exempt from the levy. The Act also provides for development and biannual update of the National Action Plan for energy from renewable sources. The latest one has been elaborated for the period 2010-2020 and sets a 13% target for renewable energy in gross final consumption by 2020 (base year 2005).

														1685.0		Action Plan for a fossil-fuel independent vehicle fleet	executive	Following from Sweden's Integrated Climate and Energy Policy Bills, this action plan sets out the specific measures to achieve the objective of a fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet by 2030. Given that one third of emissions occur in the road-based transportation sector, the fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet is a key contribution to Sweden's GHG emission reduction target. The key principle is to put a price on the GHG emissions emitted by the transportation sector and thus encouraging a move towards fossil fuel independent fuels as non-fossil fuel based vehicles are becoming cheaper than fossil fuel based vehicles. This is to be achieved through various policy instruments, measures, initiatives and incentives. These include carbon pricing (emission trading, energy and especially carbon taxes) in the transportation sector, increasing the dialogue between the government and the automotive cluster to strengthen its long-term competitiveness and promote greener fuel development and vehicle technology, extension of subsidies to establish filling stations for renewable fuels, increasing the share of biofuels in road transportation fuels via implementing the EU fuel quality directive (up to 10% share of biodiesel in the mixture), the requirement that thesustainability criteria must be fulfilled if the biofuels are to count towards the 10% target of fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020; mandating of binding emission standards for automotive manufacturers at 120gCO2/km for new passenger cars, which will be gradually reduced to 95gCO2/km in 2020; exploring the potential for the use of biogas (e.g. from waste) as transportation fuel, i.e. the development of 2nd generation biofuel via financial support (SEK875m USD118.4m) for biofuel demo-plants and the commercialisation of new energy technology; research and development initiatives to assess the incentives for the emerging electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids market, including appropriate stimulus and raising public awareness via consumer information on vehicle fuel consumption.

The objective is to include agriculture and forestry into European climate mitigation efforts. This decision is a direct response to the UNFCCC decision in 2011 to revise the accounting rules for GHG emissions and removals from forests and soils. It meets international standards by maintaining the voluntary nature of accounting for draining and rewetting of wetlands, but goes beyond the UNFCCC decision by making accounting for cropland and grassland management mandatory for member states. The new rules are intended to better recognise the efforts of farmers and forest owners to maintain carbon stored in soils and forests and to facilitate a more climate-friendly architecture (funds are available through the Common Agricultural Policy's Rural Development pillar), protecting water resources and biodiversity. It also contains reporting requirements for Member States on their initiatives to decrease emissions from forestry and agriculture-related activities as well as increase the carbon sink. The directive does not set targets for reducing GHG in agriculture and forestry as the accounting rules set out by this directive first need to prove to be sufficiently robust.

They apply to all fuels used in road transportation, including petrol, diesel and biofuels, and to gasoil that is used in non-road mobile machinery. The 10% target comprises 6% reduction of GHG intensity of fuels by 2020, 2% reduction of GHG intensity depending on the development of new technologies and 2% reduction from purchasing Clean Development Mechanism credits. The Directive requires calculation of fuel GHG intensity on a life-cycle basis, calculated from a 2010 baseline. To limit the undesired impacts of biofuel production, it establishes criteria to enable biofuels to be counted towards GHG emission reduction targets. Biofuel GHG emissions must be >35% lower than the fossil fuel they are replacing, increasing to >50% by 2017 and >60% from 2018. Raw materials for biofuels may not be taken from land with high carbon stocks (e.g. peat lands) or high biodiversity. However, the implementing measures of the Fuel Quality Directive have not been adopted and it has thus only limited impact.

In the 2010 recast, the EU executive expects the overhaul to bring its energy consumption down by 5-6%, consequently slashing CO2 emissions by 5% by 2020. Requires a common methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings. This includes: minimum standards on the energy performance of new buildings, and existing buildings that are subject to major renovation: systems for the energy certification of new and existing buildings and the prominent display of this certification and other relevant information for public buildings. Certificates must be less than five years old. Regular inspection of boilers and central air conditioning systems in buildings and an assessment of heating installations in which the boilers are more than 15 years old must be conducted. In the 2018 recast, public buildings will have nearly zero-energy standards and by 2020, all new buildings are to be nearly zero-energy. Eliminating the current 1,000m² threshold would mean that all existing buildings undergoing major renovations would have to meet minimum efficiency levels. Member States are responsible for drawing up the minimum standards and ensuring that the certification and inspection of buildings is carried out by qualified and independent personnel. The Directive 2018/844 amends the previous documents. It notably requires Member States to publish strategiesto 2050 on achieving a 'highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock'. It also requires renovation strategies with 2030, 3040 and 2050 as target years, promotes the use o smart technologies, and requires minimum levels of electric-vehicle charging points in new or renovated buildings.

														1255.0		Combined Heat and Power Act (KWKG)	legislative	This Act aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants, to support the launch of the fuel cell sector and funding for construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems. The law intends to contribute to an increase in electricity generation from CHP by 25% by 2020 through the modernisation of existing and construction of new CHP plants. It replaces a 2000 law on CHP. Both laws are primarily intended to promote large CHP plants affected by decreasing electricity prices as a consequence of liberalisation. At the same time the share of CHP-produced electricity was to increase to lower CO2 emissions by 23m tonnes by 2010. Half of this target is to be achieved by the CHP law, the other half by a voluntary agreement with industry. Renewable energy technologies not covered by the EEG may benefit from this law, including co-firing of biomass in fossil-fuelled power plants and biomass-fired CHP larger than 20MW. The premium cannot be combined with other support, particularly not with the EEG. In the original (2002) act, only the CHP share of the quantity of electricity produced was subsidised, which was fed into the grid at all voltage levels for general supply. With effect from 1 January 2009, CHP electricity that is fed into non-public grids or is used for self-supply is also subsidised. Subsidies for new heat networks or expanding heat networks were also included. The 2009 amendment aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants by promoting the modernisation and construction of CHP plants, support for the fuel cell sector and the funding for the construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems, and the construction and extension of heat and cold storage capacity. With the amendments in 2008 and 2009, the percentage share of high-efficiency CHP plants in electricity and heat generation (primary energy use over 90%) will be increased from 12% to 25%. District heat networks will also be expanded.		Germany	DEU	Industry,Energy			Law	Energy Supply, Energy Demand		published

														1277.0		Law no. 2244/1994 on the Regulation of power generation issues from renewable energy sources and conventional fuels and other provisions	legislative	This law establishes the legal basis for the development of renewable energy in Greece, providing access to the grid for individual energy producers. The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) holds the exclusive rights for the production, transfer and distribution of electricity throughout the country. However, the Minister of the relevant department (now the MEECC) can authorise individual producers (natural or legal entities) to produce electricity at power stations which belong to them (as opposed to those which belong to the PPC), introducing thus for the first time an element of energy market liberalisation, applicable for the generation of electricity for installations up to 50MW. These natural or legal entities can either produce electricity for personal use (self-producers) or they can sell it to the PPC (independent producers). Individual energy producers can use renewable sources, such as wind power, solar power, biomass, geothermal resources and hydropower. Addressing energy consumption, the legislation adopted a fixed feed-in price for renewables of roughly 90% of the household electricity rate. The law also sets general provisions for the licensing and function of power stations, the pricing of electricity production from individual producers and the technical and economic terms for contracts between individual producers and the PPC. The Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving is set to be the national centre for the co-ordination of all the activities related to renewable sources of energy.

General objectives and priorities of the period between 2008 and 2025 are set, and the strategy is to be implemented by the National Climate Change Program (NCCP). The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU. The implementation phase first addresses adoption of a National Climate Change Programme (NCCP) for a two-year period. Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity). The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change. The government prepares annual reports on the progress of implementation of the NCCS to Parliament. The 2008 text was updated in 2017 to cover the period 2017-2030 (previously 2008-2025).

														1309.0		Law No. 19.940 modifying the General Electrical Services Law (LGSE) of 1982	legislative	The law reformed the LGSE, changing several aspects of the energy generation market in Chile that affected all forms of energy generation, but included special provisions for Non-Conventional Renewable Energy sources (NCREs), defined as wind, hydropower installations up to 20MW, biomass, biogas, geothermal, solar and tidal energy. The reform opened up the spot market and guaranteed the right to be connected to the country's power grids to small generating plants, many of which fall into the NCRE category. This move increased commercial and generating opportunities for these small producers. In addition, the reform exempted projects using NCREs from paying transmission fees, using a differentiated scaleone for plants generating up to 9 MW and another for those generating between 9MW and 20MW. In addition to benefiting those sources, this exemption serves to recognise a positive externality, given their low impact on transmission grids and on invest-ments associated with their expansion.

The two decrees repealed two previous decrees of 2001 about the identifi-cation of quantitative national targets for energy savings and development of renewable sources. Energy - demand-side policies: In compliance with specific energy conservation targets, all Italian electricity and gas distributors with at least 100,000 end customers at the close of 2001 can - as of May 2006 - trade white certificates of certified energy savings. The white certificates represent marketable documents issued by the Energy Market Administrator testifying the energy saved by the energy distribution companies - as well as by their controlled partnerships - and by the Energy Service Companies (ESCO). The white certificates can be exchanged by means of bilateral contracts, or in the frame of a specific market ruled by GME. Energy service providers, subsidiaries of electricity and gas distributors and distributors themselves will all sell energy efficiency certificates (white certificates) each representing primary energy savings of one tonne of oil equivalent (toe). Distribution companies must meet specified energy savings targets, either by implementing energy conservation projects that benefit their customers, which will earn them white certificates, or through the purchase of white certificates produced by energy conservation projects undertaken by others.

Energy - demand-side policies: the 1999 Electricity Liberalisation Act and Decrees from the Ministries of Trade and Industry and of Environment (Legislative decree 79/99 of 16 March 1999 entitled; Ministry of Productive Activities decree 18.03.02; Followed by Ministry of Productive Activities decree 14.03.04, implementing the rules for the green certificates) introduced a cap-and-trade mechanism to promote renewable energy sources. It required Italian energy producers and importers (producing or importing more than 100 GWh/year from conventional sources) to ensure that a certain quota of electricity fed into the grid comes from renewable energy sources, aiming at a general reduction of CO2 emissions of about 4Mt - 6Mt by 2006. A 2% quota obligation was set, strengthened in 2003 and again in 2008. Producers and importers can comply with the obligation by means of green certificates. They can buy those certificates through bilateral contracts or by participating in the green certificates platform (managed by GME, the energy markets operator). Suppliers can fulfil the obligation by buying green certificates from eligible new renewable energy plants, by building new renewable energy plants or by importing electricity from new renewable energy plants from countries with similar instruments on the basis of reciprocity. Renewable energy producers in operation before 31 December 2007 can obtain green certificates for 12 years. Subsequent regulatory interventions have increased the incentive period to 15 years.

														1416.0		Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Act) (Law No.49 of 1979)	legislative	The Law is the pillar of Japanese energy conservation policy as well as one of the two key climate law. It was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock with a purpose of promoting effective and rational use of energy. It covers the following sectors: energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances. The subjects of the Law are factories and workplaces that consume more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent energy annually. Among factories, there are two categories: Factory I that uses more than 3,000kL equivalent; and Factory II that uses between 1,500-3,000kL equivalent. Currently, it covers approximately 90% of the operators in the industrial sector. Energy defined under this Law covers energies derived from oil, natural gas, coals, heat (fossil-derived) and other sources of energy derived from the above. Electricity derived from renewable sources such as solar PV, wind and biomass are not subject for this Law. Designated businesses are required to produce reports (regular reporting for Factory II, both regular and mid-term reporting for Factory I) to the Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The purpose of this is to report amount of fuel, heat and electricity used in the subject period. Reduction target of 1% on average is set out under the law, with a fine up to JPY1m (USD8,495) according to the violation. This Law also mandates an appointment of licensed energy managers for the designated businesses. Other measures include energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, energy conservation labelling, energy regulation for housing and building and Positive Evaluation of Action to Reduce Peak Demand Electricity. The Top Runner Programme was introduced in a 1990 amendment, which certifies manufacturers and other entities that satisfy 'Top Runner' criteria. Criteria for the energy-saving performance regarding their products within the target fiscal years (within 3 to 10 years) are set based on the performance of the products with the highest (according to latest level) energy consumption efficiency (top runner performance). The programme applies to machinery, equipment, and building materials, as well as LED lamps and three phase induction motors. The last amendment, in November 2014, added windows to the programme.

														1419.0		General Electricity Law No 64 of 2003	legislative	This law is a general regulatory framework for the generation, distribution and sale of electricity in the Kingdom, and has been updated over the years. The 2003 update includes language that is directly related to climate change despite the fact that the law does not name climate change as an objective. The law states that energy efficiency shall be a national priority, a precursor to the law concerning renewable energy summarised above. In addition, the General Electricity Law grants authority to the Electricity Sector Regulatory Commission to provide incentives (not specified in the law) to encourage improved technological efficiency; and to participate in the regulation of efficiency standards for electric devices officially issued by the Standards and Meteorology Corporation. Previous additions to the law passed in 2002 allowed private energy companies to access to the electricity grids as well as set guidelines for renewable energy projects. Large-scale projects (above 5MW) would be contracted through competitive tendering (no longer necessary due to the provision in the renewable energy law), small-scale (below 5MW) through direct negotiations and very small scale (below 1MW) for auto-generation and only to be bought during peak demand.

														1422.0		The Ecological Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, No. 212 of 2007and Amendment to said legislation on 3 December 2011	legislative	The Ecological Code is a general law that addresses a variety of environmental and climate issues. It codifies ecological definitions of terms into law, establishes the authority of the government to regulate different aspects of the natural environment, stipulates various institutional relations between governmental departments, and lays the groundwork for environmental impact studies among many other regulatory provisions. It includes provisions related to climate change and an amendment passed in 2011 allows Kazakhstan to operate a national carbon trading scheme. It states that the state shall prioritise prevention and mitigation of climate change and regulate according to principles that limit the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere. The law authorises a governmental body to monitor climate change and ozone layer and further charges that body with using scientific information to develop measures at the national level specific to various economic sectors to reduce the discharge of GHGs into the atmosphere. The law also outlines the regulatory authority of the state of Kazakhstan to issue limits (quotas) on the emissions of GHGs and ozone-destroying gases. The regulatory authority lies with a government body to be specified by the state, which will determine maximum quotas, and issue permits for the import of substances harmful to the ozone. The details of the carbon trading scheme were not included in the amendment but issued in a series of executive decrees.

														1421.0		Law about Support of Use of Renewable Sources of Energy No. 165-4	legislative	This piece of legislation aims to eliminate previous legal and financial barriers to the development of renewable energy projects, thus facilitating new projects and access to regional energy grids, as well as regulating energy pricing to ensure that energy from renewable sources is cost-comparable to fossil fuels. The law was a necessary step in order to realise the reduction in GHG emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy (defined as solar, wind hydropower, biomass, and geothermal energy) consumed relative to fossil fuels. The law does not, however, specify a percentage share of renewable energy. The text lays the legal framework to develop national and regional programmes to exploit renewable energy, establish norms associated with renewable energy production, and issue permits for new projects and plants. This regulatory authority will rest in a government-authorised body (of the executive branch) in charge of all renewable energy programmes. At the regional and local levels, the Authority both authorises local executive authorities to participate in the planning and approval of local and regional projects to develop renewable energy up to 25MW and obliges them to reserve and allocate local lands to said projects, within the framework of the law. Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of 'service payments' associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy. This law codifies the requirement that by 2024 5% of Kazakhstan's total energy consumption must come from renewable sources.

														1699.0		National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation	executive	The National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation was approved and adopted by the Governmental Decree No.259. The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors. The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health. To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions. Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection.

The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework. The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs. The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996. As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014). Since its introduction in 1998 several amendments have been made to incorporate new elements such as the transposition of EU Directives. Several changes have been introduced in the E- Act in 2010, such as smart metering and congestion management rules for electricity) in order to improve the Dutch energy market. The Electricity Act 1998 is currently being amended.		Netherlands	NLD	Industry,Energy			Law	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply		published

The ultimate goal envisioned is for Pakistan to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2047. The following pillars of the vision meet elements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs): - People first: developing social and human capital and empowering women - Growth: sustained, indigenous, and inclusive growth - Governance: democratic governance - institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector - Security: energy, water and food security - Entrepreneurship: private sector and entrepreneurship-led growth - Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition - Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity. While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document: - Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days - Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index - Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas - Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species - Energy security: alternative energy - Institutions that favour the status quo - Infrastructure bottleneck. The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows: - Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity - Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population - Improve generation mix (15%) and reduce distribution losses (10%) to reduce average cost per unit by over 25% - Increase the share of indigenous sources of power generation to over 50% - Address demand management by increasing usage of energy efficient appliances and products to 80% - Increase water storage capacity to 90 days - Improve water use efficiency in agriculture by 20% - Ensure access to clean drinking water for all citizens - Reduce food insecure population from 60% to 30%.

														1530.0		National Forest Policy	executive	This policy (supported by caveats in the National Environment Policy) addresses the sustainable use of renewable natural resources. It acknowledges the multiple functions of Pakistan's forests, such as carbon storage for climate change mitigation. However, there is a particularly strong focus on forests' role in mountain areas where they provide protection from soil erosion and reduction of downstream siltation; and crucially, watershed protec-tion. It also notes the potential of forests to support local livelihoods in terms of provision of non-timber forest products (mushrooms, medicinal plants etc.). Much of Pakistan's forests have now been cleared, increasing the importance of managing what remains under a framework of sustainable use. In particular the sustainable use should benefit marginalised groups such as women and children. Use of existing resources should be complemented with forest restoration activities to attempt to regenerate forests in order to safeguard economic growth. Approaches to achieve the desired sustainable use of forests include the substitution of firewood and timber (specifically discouraging the use of rare species in government buildings); and the prevention of encroachment on remaining forest lands through regulation of grazing. In order to finance the protection of watersheds and safeguard Pakistan's water supply, the forest policy stipulates the creation of a forest fund. The fund may also be used to finance the promotion of forestry research and education in Pakistan. The National Forest Policy 2015 is a broad update of the 2010 document.

														1543.0		Law to Promote Efficient Use of Energy, Law No. 27345 and Executive Decree No. 053-2007-EM to Regulate Corresponding Law No. 27345	legislative	The Law declares the promotion of energy efficiency a matter of national interest. The motivations listed in the bill are to ensure a stable energy supply, protect the consumer, improve competitiveness of the national market and to reduce environmental damage caused by energy consumption. The Law requires the Ministry of Energy and Mining to promote a culture of energy efficiency and to design and fund energy efficiency projects. However, the legislation is vague on details and activities to be realised. The one exception is the labelling of electronic appliances and machines of energy consumption information within 90 days after the law has taken into affect. The Executive Decree details how the Ministry of Energy and Mining is to realise the mandates of the corresponding law. In order to encourage a culture of energy efficiency, the Ministry is to co-ordinate education programmes for the general public and in primary and secondary schools, as well as co-ordinate the establishment of undergraduate and graduate degree programmes in energy efficiency. Additionally, 21 October is celebrated as National Energy Saving Day. The Ministry will encourage energy efficiency in homes and residences with publicity campaigns meant to change consumption behaviour; promote the financing of energy efficient electrical systems appliances; and encourage the use of energy efficient technologies in remote areas. In the service and private industry sectors the Ministry will promote the creation of an 'energy efficiency market'; create standards of energy efficiency for private enterprises; create minimum standards of energy efficiency depending on the type of productive activity; co-ordinate the financing of small and medium enterprises to establish pilot projects meant to make energy use more efficient; and coordinate with the National Commission on Climate Change and the National Environmental Fund to facilitate international financing through the Clean Development Mechanisms. In the public sector the Ministry will audit the use of energy by public entities that use more than a pre-established amount of energy units; co-ordinate efficient lighting systems; and co-ordinate the conversion of public sector vehicles to run on natural gas. In the transportation sector, the Ministry will co-ordinate with the appropriate public entities to encourage efficient use of public transportation systems and optimise traffic systems to mitigate idle use of fuels. The Ministry should co-ordinate the replication of successful projects at the Regional Government level.

														1533.0		National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS): Pakistan's pathway to a sustainable and resilient future	executive	The goal of the NSDS is 'vibrant and equitable economic growth' that delivers benefits to all, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, in a way which does not lead to undue exploitation or degradation of natural resources. The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges: Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding. The three core programme areas addressed are: ? Economic: Sustainable trade, Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Consumption ? Environment: Natural capital and Biodiversity ? Social: Social protection, poverty alleviation and equal opportunity/human development. The strategic goals of the programme are to: - Promote green investment and green jobs - Improve eco-efficiency by changing production and consumption systems - Internalisation of environmental costs into pricing - Develop sustainable infrastructure focusing on transportation and communication - Develop demand for sustainable consumption among consumers through awareness raising - Account for depletion of natural resources in national accounts - Promote efficient use of energy and water, including through improved watershed management and reforestation - Improve biodiversity management and increase forest cover; prepare lists of endangered species - Deliver basic services of acceptably high quality to all citizens. These would cover 10 years of schooling, healthcare, food, water, shelter and energy - Ensure preparedness for natural and human-made calamity and emergencies through mitigation and integration of disaster contingencies in broader development strategies.

														1548.0		Framework Strategy on Climate Change	executive	The National Framework Strategy sketches a clean development path, and serves as a roadmap for national and sub-national development and investment programmes, physical and land use programmes. Acknowledging the Philippines' vulnerability to climate change, the Framework's vision is 'to build the adaptive capacity of communities and increase resilience of natural eco-systems to climate change, and optimise mitigation opportunities towards sustainable development'. On renewable energy, it states a target of doubling renewable energy capacity from 4,500 MW to 9,000 MW in the next 20 years The mitigation pillar leans on managing energy demand, via energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and on energy supply, via use of low-carbon and renewable energy resources, targeting a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It encourages low-carbon transportation modes (LPG, bio-fuels) and sustainable, energy-conserving infrastructure building. The infrastructure emphasises the importance of REDD+ policies as a measure to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Waste management and methane collection are also included in mitigation priorities. The Adaptation pillar includes enhanced vulnerability and adaptation assessments, eco-system management (river basin management, coastal and marine systems, biodiversity); water management; climate-responsive agriculture; climate-responsive health sector; climate-proofing infrastructure; and disaster risk reduction. The synergy between mitigation and adaptation is emphasised, and cross-cutting strategies are portrayed, among others capacity building in all level of governance, knowledge management and education; research and development and technology transfer. The framework presents the Philippines' second GHG emission inventory (updated to 2000), which has been prepared for the second communication to the UNFCCC.

The CPCDM is headed by a private individual and Co-Chaired by a DOE undersecretary, with nine other government agencies and six private organisations and NGOs making up the CPCDM Committee. The major role of CPCDM is to promote power conservation and demand management through an information, education and communication campaign (IEC) in the commercial, industrial, residential and academic sectors. To raise public awareness, a multitude of seminar-workshops were held in major cities and municipalities throughout the country. Provincial, city or municipal chapters were formed and headed by the President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) from said region, city or municipality. These chapters are mirror image of the national CPCDM Committee and were designed to provide sustainability of the whole program concept that is to propagate values formation among energy users. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is part of the activity during the formal establishment of a chapter in a locality. Participation in the seminar-workshop varies depending on the target sectors. For the academe, students from grade 5 and 6 elementary and 3rd and 4th year high school were invited to attend, while plant facility personnel, employees and managers of companies from commercial and industrial sectors likewise attended. Similarly, household owners and members of home associations and the Barangay Chairman and Council members were the target participants to represent the Barangay residential sector.

														1561.0		Energy Efficiency Law	legislative	This Act transposes Directive 2006/32/EC into Polish law, establishing the legal framework for stimulating investment in energy efficiency in Poland. The system is based on the obligation of the specified entities to obtain and present for cancellation to the President of the Energy Regulatory Authority specified number of certificates of energy efficiency (the so called white certificates) or the payment of a replacement fee. This obligation has been imposed on energy companies selling electricity, heat and natural gas to end-users connected to the Polish network, as well as end-users of energy and brokerage houses and commodity brokerage houses, conducting transactions on a commodity exchange market. Following the issuance of the EEL, the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued secondary legislation to enable the EEL to enter into force: Decree of 10 August 2012 that detailed the procedure of energy efficiency audit and describes the methods of computing energy savings; Decree of 4 September 2012 on computing primary energy savings for the purpose of the White Certificate System (WCS) and the compensation fee in the system; Decree of 23 October 2012 on the procedures of the bid for the White Certificates and listed the eligible energy efficiency means eligible in the WCS. The original EEL was amended on 10 October 2012, dropping the articles that defined specific requirements of the energy efficiency auditors. This move was mainly induced by the government's policy to open different occupations to make the market of services they provide more competitive and flexible. The extent of the current Energy Efficiency Law (EEL) is limited to 2016 and due to some legal constraints the bill cannot be amended. Therefore the law is planned to be replaced by a new legal act that will extend the duration of energy efficiency law beyond 2016.

														1599.0		Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS II) for 2013-2018	executive	EDPRS II aims to implement Rwanda's Vision 2020, ensuring that the country achieves middle-income status by 2020 by accelerating economic growth to (11.5% average), reducing poverty to below 30%, and restructuring the economy towards services and industry. Its main targets relate to: strategic infrastructure investment for exports; more private sector financing to increase exports; urbanisation; and a green economy approach to sustainability. Five priority areas will spearhead this thematic strategy. Priority 1 is to increase the domestic interconnectivity of the economy by investing in infrastructure to meet private sector energy demand; increasing access to public goods and resources in priority sectors; and deepening the integration of key value chains. Priority 5 is the pursuit of a green economy' approach to economic transformation, favouring the development of sustainable cities and villages. Key innovations include: piloting a green city; piloting a model mine; and attracting investors in green construction. There will be a focus on green urbanisation and promoting green innovation in industry and the private sector. A Green Urbanisation Centre of Excellence and an Environment and Climate Change Innovation Centre will be created. The Environment and Climate Change Centre will promote transformational green innovation in the industrial and private sectors through (i) support to research and development through links to industry and academia in Rwanda and internationally; (ii) promoting technology transfer in priority sectors through business advice and training; (iii) linking innovation with finance through identifying international funding sources (e.g. FONERWA); (iv) providing analyses and information on market and sector trends. Environment and climate change are considered cross cutting issues'. They involve (i) mainstreaming environmental sustainability into productive and social sectors; (ii) reducing vulnerability to climate change and (iii) preventing and controlling pollution. Key sectors include agriculture, energy, environment and natural resources, infrastructure, health, private sector and financial sector. EDPRS II supports the previous target of increasing forest cover to 23.5% by 2012 and reset a new indicator to reach 30% by 2018. In addition, it recommends for sustainable management of forest biodiversity and critical ecosystems through protection and maintenance of 10.25% of the land area, and reduction of wood energy consumption from 86.3 % to 50% by 2020 as reflected in the 2020 Vision targets.

														1605.0		Rwanda Vision 2020	executive	Vision 2020 is a framework for Rwanda's development, presenting the key priorities and providing Rwandans with a guiding tool for the future. It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today). The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%). Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems. To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population.

														1662.0		Royal Decree Law 2/2013, which implements urgent measures in the electricity and financial sectors	executive	This Royal Decree-Law is the 7th Royal Decree Law establishing Spain's energy reform. The first was Royal Decree Law 1/2012, suspending payment of pre-allocation processes and suspending financial incentives for new electricity production installations using co-generation, renewable energy sources and waste. This Law adopts a series of measures to reduce costs in the electricity system and save, according to government estimates, EUR600-EUR800m (USD753m-USD1.001bn) per year. It cancels the premium established in electricity sector regulations for special regime installations that sell their energy to the market. The Law also contains provisions related to the economic regime applicable to installations using innovative solar thermoelectric technology and other technologies that are successful in context of the competitive tender processes. Following the edition of Royal Decree Law 2/2013, Royal Decree Law 9/2013, of 12 July, continued establishing a series of urgent measures to ensure financial stability of the electricity system. To this end, Royal Decree Law 9/2013 adopts a new legal and economic framework for facilities producing energy from renewable sources, cogeneration and waste. It establishes that as from 1 January 2013, all remuneration, tariffs and premiums received by the parties to the electric system whose update is linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The remuneration will be updated using as a reference the CPI at a constant tax rate, not including either unprocessed foods or energy products.

														1666.0		Royal Decree 564/2017 on the certification of energy efficiency in buildings (amending Royal Decree 235/2013)	executive	This Decree establishes the technical and administrative conditions for certification of energy efficiency of buildings and the methodology for calculating its energy efficiency rating. The purpose of the basic procedure is to promote energy efficiency, using information on the energy characteristics of buildings, in the form of an energy performance certificate that must be provided to buyers and users. This basic procedure applies to new buildings; buildings or parts of buildings which are sold or leased to a new tenant, provided they do not hold a current certificate; and buildings or parts of buildings in which a public authority occupies a total useful floor area of 250 m2 and are frequently visited by the public. A series of exceptions to the procedure are detailed and include buildings officially protected as part of a specific environment or due to their architectural or historical value, in the case that the minimum energy performance requirements would alter their character or appearance. Other exceptions are buildings with a usable area smaller than 50 m2, and industrial, military and non-residential agricultural buildings that are already considered having a low energy demand. The Decree also establishes an Advisory Commission to certify the energy efficiency of buildings, responsible for advising the competent ministries in matters relating to the energy performance of buildings. One of the government representatives in this Commission is from the Spanish Climate Change Office.

														1668.0		Law 24/2013 on the Electric sector	legislative	This Law repealed Law 54/1997, which previously regulated the sector. The main driver for the law was to reduce the unsustainable tariff deficit of the electricity sector. A new support scheme for renewable energy sources is planned, based on the direct participation of renewable energy sources in the market, forcing them to compete with traditional sources, although the scheme will allow renewable energies to recover costs that could not be recovered by selling energy on the market. The evaluation of such costs will be based on a theoretical renewable plant and on the average costs incurred by a well-managed company running said installation. Only administrative costs that are uniform at national level will be considered, so administrative costs at regional level are not considered in the framework of the law. The law allows for additional support schemes, but only if they are necessary to achieve European goals. With respect to grid access and grid use, renewables are granted priority connection and priority dispatch - provided that these do not constitute a danger to the grid itself. Law 24/2013 regulates the economic framework for self-production-and consumption of electricity, a topic that had been in debate for months between different stakeholders. It states that entities that consume the energy they produce will have to make the same contribution to the financing of costs and services of the grid as consumers that take the electricity directly from the grid. This point had been at the centre of the debate and was strongly opposed by renewable energy associations, who thought it would create strong barriers to consumers installing their own renewable generating system. The fine for producers who access the self-consumption scheme incorrectly is set between EUR6m and EUR60m (USD7.53m-USD75.3m). Order 360/2018 foresees an update, at least annual, of the remuneration related to production facilities from renewable sources, high efficiency cogeneration and waste. and This document is detailed by Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 and Royal Decree 244/2019 on self-consumption.

														1669.0		Law 2/2011, on Spain's Sustainable Economy, regulated by Royal Decrees 1494/2011 and 1.007/2015	legislative	This Law aims to make the economy more competitive by promoting environmental sustainability in sectors such as energy, transport and sustainable mobility, and housing. The Law has four sections. The first is dedicated to improving the economic environment. The second addresses competitiveness and the third, environmental sustainability. The fourth deals with how to implement and evaluate the Law. The major principles of environmental sustainability are the guarantee of economic efficiency, respect for the environment, national objectives for 2020 on energy saving and efficiency and on the use of renewable energy. Energy policy should promote renewable energy, strengthen predictability and efficiency in energy policy decisions - especially as regards the incentives framework - and cut back the contribution of energies with higher CO2 emission potential. The law establishes a national target of 20% of energy consumption to come from renewable energy by 2020 for both homes and commercial buildings. It also creates the Carbon Fund for a Sustainable Economy (FES - CO2), which will help to reduce GHG emissions by buying carbon credits. The purpose Royal Decree 1.007/2015 is to regulate the specific procedure for the acquisition of carbon credits, within the framework of the PIMA Company Plan, to companies that carry out actions that meet the requirements established in this standard, by the Carbon Fund to a Sustainable Economy (FES-CO2) provided for in the Sustainable Economy Law 2/2011.

														1678.0		Law 34/1998, on the hydrocarbons sector	legislative	This law regulates activities involving liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. The following activities are included within the scope of this Act: (a) Exploration, research and mining of deposits and underground stores of hydrocarbons. (b) Foreign trade, refining, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil (petroleum) and petroleum products including liquefied petroleum gases. (c) The acquisition, production, liquefaction, regasification, transportation, storage, distribution and trading of gas fuels through pipelines. Law 12/2007 modified Law 34/1998, introducing the obligation to use biofuels in transport. Law 17/2013 also modified the law, confirming the government's support of fracking. The new text expressly states that hydraulic fracturing techniques are permitted (provided that they comply with the environmental assessment standards - for which purpose fracking projects have been included within Annex I of the Law on Environmental Assessment). In September 2014, the Spanish Council of Ministers submitted to Parliament a draft bill for the amendment of the Hydrocarbons Act ( (the Hydrocarbons Act Reform) to implement the Gas Hub. The Hydrocarbons Act Reform also leaves open the possibility that the regulator may amend the regulatory regime applicable to the gas transmission network and the six LNG terminals to facilitate access to that infrastructure for gas traders. The Hydrocarbons Act Reform is expected to come into force by July 2015, and the Spanish Gas Hub to be fully operational by October 2015.

														1095.0		National Energy Plan 2030 (PNE 2030)	executive	The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources. As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil - 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources). The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010). According to the PNE 2030, energy efficiency policy will be built in aiming at guiding a set of priority projects, to be conducted under the guidance of MME, in co-ordination with the other agents of the Government. The formulation of effective regulatory mechanisms and instruments for inspection will involve the regulatory agencies in the energy sector. The establishment of an operational structure able to manage implementing this policy also involves budgetary resources consistent with the importance of this mission.

														1680.0		Act on Electricity certificates: Act No. 2011:1200 and Regulation on Electricity certificates - Regulation No. 2011:1480	legislative	Electricity producers whose electricity production meets the requirements of the Electricity Certificates Act receive one electricity certificate unit for each MWh of electricity that they produce. Demand for certificates is created by the fact that all electricity suppliers, and also certain electricity end users, are required to purchase certificates corresponding to a certain proportion (quota) of their electricity sales or electricity use. Electricity from the following energy sources entitles its producers to certificates in Sweden: wind power, solar energy, wave energy, geothermal energy, biofuels, peat and hydro power. The act applies to - Companies that supply electricity to consumers - Consumers of electricity using self-produced electricity, while the consumption must exceed 60MWh/ year and must have been produced in a plant that has a capacity of more than 50kW - Registered energy-intensive companies - Electricity consumers that purchased/imported electricity from the Nordic electricity market As of 1 January 2012, the Swedish-Norwegian common electricity certificate market started. The producers receive their certificates in the country where the electricity production takes place and can trade their certificates in both Norway and Sweden.

														1681.0		Government Bill (2009/2010: 172) & Government Bill (2009/2010:173) on nuclear power	legislative	Passed by the Riksdag, these laws originating in government bills regulate the conditions for constructing and operating new nuclear facilities. New units are only permitted when they replace existing units (a maximum of 10), whereby the older reactor must be permanently disabled and the new reactor needs to be built on an existing nuclear facility instead of a new location. The laws reverse the phase-out of nuclear power production, repealing the Nuclear Phase-Out Act and the ban on new nuclear power facilities. The purpose of the law is to allow old nuclear reactors to be replaced with newer, safer models. It also reflects the recent shift towards new carbon technologies as opposed to a stronger expansion of renewable energies classified as counting towards climate mitigation. The Swedish parliament approved the act under the condition that no direct or indirect public funding may be available for the new nuclear power reactors. Parliament also stipulated that operators of nuclear facilities and the owners of nuclear power reactors carry unlimited liability in the event of a nuclear accident. Companies are required to hold insurance against third-party claims up to EUR1.2bn (USD1.51bn).

														1765.0		Renewables Obligation	legislative	The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the current main mechanism for supporting large-scale generation of renewable electricity. It has been subject to various reforms and improvements. It is a market-based mechanism, designed to provide a substantial incentive for all eligible forms of renewable electricity. The RO places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6. Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less. Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enables generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, further changes included the RO being extended from its current end date of 2027 to 2037 for new projects, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RO. Their functions include accrediting renewable generators and the issuing of ROCs.		United Kingdom	GBR	Waste,Energy			Law	Energy Supply		published

														1733.0		The Renewable Energy Policy for Uganda	executive	The Renewable Energy Policy follows the commitment in the National Energy Policy 2002 to develop the use of renewable energy resources in Uganda. The Government's overarching policy vision for renewable energy is to make modern renewable energy a substantial part of national energy consumption, where modern renewable energy is understood to mean renewable energy resources that are transformed into modern energy services like electricity. To achieve its goal, a number of supporting objectives are identified. These include: maintaining and improving the responsiveness of the legal and institutional framework to promote renewable energy investments; establishing an financing and fiscal policy framework for investments in renewable energy; increasing public awareness in renewable energy and promoting investment in this area; promoting research and development as well as international co-operation in renewable energy technologies (RETs); utilizing biomass energy efficiently and sustainably; and promoting the conversion of municipal and industrial waste to energy. Various strategies and policy actions are elaborated in order to achieve these objectives. A power generation programme will support public and private sector investments in renewable energy, focussing on large hydropower schemes (hydropower being the most well developed RET) as well as small and more diverse schemes. A rural and urban-poor electricity access programme will support the development of RETs in dispersed and remote settlements. A modern energy services programme will support RETs such as solar PV and solar water heaters, a biofuels programme will support improvements in biofuel technology, and a waste for energy programmes will support the conversion of waste to energy. An energy efficiency programmes will implement the Uganda Energy Efficiency Strategy. The responsibility for the policy lies with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and a Renewable Energy Department is to be developed within the Ministry. Moreover, a special financial mechanism, a credit support facility known as the Uganda Energy Capitalisation Trust, is instituted to help realise the policy. The ultimate goal of the Renewable Energy Policy is to increase the use of modern renewable energy, from the current 4% to 61% of the total energy consumption by the year 2017.

The amendment by Law 601-VI defined green tariff as the special rate to purchase electricity produced by through alternative energy sources. A consumer's body authorised by the Cabinet of Ministers issues a document confirming the purchase of energy generated from alternative energy sources. It also establishes that the wholesale electricity market must buy the green tariff electricity from alternative energy sources, and sell it directly to consumers or energy supplying companies. Green tariff is defined as a special tariff for electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy (except blast-furnace and coke gases; with regard to hydropower - at small plants only, i.e. with capacity up to 10 MWel). The amended Law obliges the Ukrainian wholesale electricity providers to purchase electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy through the green tariff. The green tariff was planned as a double average tariff for traditional electricity sold on the Ukrainian wholesale market in the year preceding the year of the tariff decision. The state regulator (NKRE) defines the Green Tariff based on a formula. Special fed-in (green) tariffs were established for wind, solar, biomass, biogas, small hydro (<10MW) and geothermal power plants. Green Tariffs are fixed until 2030 with guaranteed electricity of-take by the Wholesale Electricity Market Operator. Green Tariffs are revised on a monthly basis to follow changes in UAH/EUR currency exchange rate. Green Tariffs are applied to new construction projects as well as renewable power plants operated before approval of the Law.

The resolution was prepared in cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corportation. The PPA is the procedure relating suppliers of green electricity and the State Enterprise Energorynok, which has a statutory obligation to purchase all electricity from renewable sources due to Law 5485-VI on green tariff (feed-in-tariff). This resolution introduces significant measures aimed at strengthening the investments in the renewable energy sector. It notably adds the possibility for market players to go to the International Criminal Court once a dispute has been dealt with by a competent commercial court in Ukraine, or if the given court has recused itself. However, the wording of the amendment does not ensure that this procedure will effectively be used. It also details grounds for payments, specifies the obligation to send hourly data directly through the system NEC ""Ukrenergo"", expands the list of circumstances deemed as a force majeure event, and extends the PPA after the liquidation of Energorynok.

														1752.0		Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme	legislative	The Scheme (formerly known as the Carbon Reduction Commitment) is a mandatory climate change and energy saving scheme. It aims to improve energy efficiency and cut emissions in large public and private sector organisations, which are responsible for around 10% of the UK's emissions. The Scheme encourages organisa-tions to develop energy management strategies that promote a better understanding of energy usage. It provides a financial incentive to reduce energy use by putting a price on carbon emissions from such use and also allows participants to make savings on energy bills through improved energy efficiency. In CRC, organisations buy allowances equal to their annual emissions. The scheme is administered by the Environment Agency, which publishes details of all participants' emissions each year.

														2054.0		National Strategy on Climate Change (Decree No. 011-2015-MINAM)	executive	"The National Strategy on Climate Change (ENCC) 2015 updates and replaces the ENCC originally adopted in 2003. It reflects the commitment of the Peruvian State to take action on climate change in an integrated, cross-cutting and multi-sectoral manner, aiming to fulfil the ""Vision for 2021"", when ""Peru will have adapted to the adverse effects of and taken advantage of the opportunities posed by climate change, laying the foundation for sustainable low carbon development"". The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy. Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators : Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are: Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural disasters linked to climate change Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change Reduce GHG emissions, while taking advantage of the opportunities associated productive transformation in key sectors such as forestry, energy, transportation, industrial and solid waste management. Reduced and continuously decreasing carbon intensity of the economy Reduction of GHG emissions in all sectors, especially carbon intensive sectors Increased carbon sequestration and net reduction of emissions in the forestry sector The ENCC mandates the production of sectoral and sub-national action plans, setting specific targets and detailing measures necessary to achieve the objectives proposed in ENCC. These are to be monitored and evaluated by the National Commission on Climate Change. These include the 2017-2021 Multiyear Sectoral Strategic Plan of the Environment Sector (PESEM) and the National Strategy on Forests and Climate Change (2016)."

A review resulted in the Climate Change Programme 2006. The 2006 Programme includes measures that are projected to reduce CO2 emissions to 15-18% below 1990 levels by 2010 and work towards the longer-term goal to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2050, as set out in 2003's Energy White Paper. Energy Efficiency Measures include: - maintain a strong package of support, advice and information measures to help businesses improve their energy efficiency - continue to use the climate change levy and associated climate change agreements to encourage businesses to improve the efficiency with which they use energy - continue the significant improvements made and update the Building Regulations in April 2006 to raise energy standards of new build and refurbished buildings - introduce the Code for Sustainable Homes. On transportation, the Programme will work strongly to achieve further commitments from vehicle manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency.

														1759.0		Code for Sustainable Homes	executive	Building on the recommendations of the Sustainable Buildings Task Group, the Code was developed to support a step change in the building of sustainable new homes. The Code provides a single national standard to guide industry in the design and construction of sustainable homes, considering energy among other aspects. Since 2007 the developer of any new home in England can choose to be assessed against the Code. From 2008 it was mandatory for all new homes to be rated against the Code and to include a Code or nil-rated certificate within the Home Information Pack. Even though the requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended in 2010, an Energy Performance Certificate is still required. There are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level. Level 1 represents a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the 2006 Building Regulations. Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances). Improvements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines).

All company cars first registered after January 1998 are taxed on a percentage of their list price according to CO2 emission bands, measured in grams per kilometre (g/km). The reform was intended to remove the perverse incentive in the existing system to reduce the tax due by driving unnecessary extra business miles and to provide a significant incentive to company cars drivers to choose more fuel-efficient vehicles. To further promote environmentally friendly vehicles, the government introduced a progressive percentage charge rate system. This system has evolved over time - as of 2011, the charge is 0% for care with zero emissions, rising stepwise to a maximum of 35% for emissions of 225g/km and higher.

Electricity produced from qualifying renewable sources and energy used and generated in approved combined heat and power schemes are no longer exempt from the levy. There is also a reduced (20%) rate for energy-intensive businesses that enter into voluntary agreements to reduce their energy use and/or emissions. The Climate Change Levy was amended on February 1st 2018. The new regulations alter the formula used to calculate relief entitlement and aligning the Levy to changes made in section 148 of the Finance Act 2016 and will be coming into force on April 1st, 2019.

It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues. The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation. It establishes an Environmental Trust Fund, funded by penalties and bonds, which is to fund research, environmental rehabilitation, monitoring and analysis, management of community conservation areas, and as required for the protection and conservation of the environment.It also makes several amendments to enforcement provisions, environmental impact assessment procedures, bio-prospecting processes, and details of what constitutes an offence (and the associated punishments) under the 2002 Act.

														1787.0		Forestry Rights Registration and Timber Harvest Guarantee Act No. 28	legislative	The Act regulates the definition, granting, transfer and registration of forestry rights in Vanuatu, and the harvesting and accreditation of timber plantations. It enables a proprietor of a lease (as registered under the Land Leases Act) to grant a forestry right over the land covered by the lease. The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land'. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.

General objectives are: reducing poverty to minimal levels; becoming a middle-income country; becoming a newly industrialised country; and consolidating democracy and enhancing national unity. It was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development. Climate change is identified in Vision 2035 as one of the two major challenges to Cameroon's economy. Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals. Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027). Specific actions include protecting and ensuring sustainable management of forest ecosystems, fighting desert encroachment and promoting regional projects like the Niger Basin and the Lake Chad Basin.Diversification of energy source and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy supplies is mentioned in the document without quantitative targets.

														1817.0		Document CONPES 3700 on the Institutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions in Climate Change	executive	The main objective of CONPES 3700 is to outline a mechanism for institutional co-ordination to incorporate climate change into sectorial and territorial decision making, the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA). CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment. The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision. A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC).

														2006.0		Act 1990:582 on Carbon Tax and related regulations	legislative	The Carbon Tax Act (as amended in 2013) introduced carbon tax on coal, oil, natural gas, petrol, and aviation fuel used in domestic travel, complementing the already existing energy taxes, aiming at supporting development of cleaner fuels while keeping the burden on the energy sector more or less constant. Initially covering the whole of the above sectors, the tax was reformed after the launch of the EU carbon-trading scheme and was kept for industry and non-industry emitters outside of the EU ETS scheme. Initially set at a general level of USD120 per ton of CO2 (different rates for coal fuels, kerosene and engine oils on domestic flights, natural gas, and LPG) - the carbon tax was progressively raised in 2013 to USD349 per tonne of CO2 for coal fuels and up to USD418 per tonne of CO2 for natural gas used for non-travel purposes for the sectors still concerned by the tax. Both peat and biofuels are exempt from the tax, as well as fuels used for electricity production. Until 2015, minor tax relief was also granted for natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used in cars, ships, and aircraft; however, from 2015 the same level of tax will apply to all fossil fuels. Additionally, EU ETS exempt industries such as agriculture, forestry and pisciculture are subject to 30% of the standard CO2 tax.

														2010.0		Act on Renewable Energy Sources ('RES Act', Dz.U. 2015 poz. 478)	legislative	This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020. The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power). The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply: support for max 15 years from the start of renewable energy production in the given installation; support for hydropower of max 5 MW of capacity; support for biomass co-firing installations of less than 150 MW capacity capped to equivalent of the average generation over 2011-2013; large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 ¬/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee. The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business. The Act was amended in June 2018, alongside the 2016 Act on investments in wind power and the 1994 Construction Act, in order to boost offshore wind investment. It was further amended in August 2019 to extend the agreements on grid connection and updates the auction mechanism.

														2012.0		Royal Decree 900/2015 on Energy Self-Consumption	executive	"The Royal Decree seeks to promote economically sustainable distributed generation and the use of renewable energies, but also introduces charges and tolls for grid access, with the goal of fair burden-sharing among electricity grid users. All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt). There are two self-consumption modalities: 'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility 'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive. All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019. Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid.

														2015.0		Energy Transition Law	legislative	The Energy Transition Act's purpose is to promote sustainable and efficient use of energy, regulate the obligations of power companies related to the mandatory share of clean energies (including natural gas, and CCS with emissions not exceeding 100 kg/MWh), and push for the reduction of the polluting emissions of the electric power industry while ensuring competitiveness of the clean power sector within the new wholesale electricity market. According to the law, the Secretariat of Energy (SENER) should promote generation of clean power to reach the levels set forth in the Climate Change Act for the electric power industry, including: a minimum share of clean energies in power generation of 25 % by 2018, 30 % by 2021, 35 % by 2024. SENER is also responsible for establishing obligations for mandatory acquisition of clean energy certificates that the suppliers and qualified users participating in the wholesale power market and the holders of interconnection agreements must comply with on an annual basis. The issuance of clean energy certificates (CECs) is expected to begin from 2018 and will serve both as a green incentive and a regulatory mechanism to meet the country's clean energy goals. A transitory provision, valid for four years, allows companies to defer 50 % of their CEC acquisition obligation for two years under specific conditions. The law also establishes the National Commission for Efficient Use of Energy (CONUEE), tasked with promoting energy efficiency, providing scientific advice in matters of clean energy, and drafting the Energy Strategy that sets medium and long term goals (15 and 30 years horizon respectively) as well as the National Programme for Sustainable Use of Energy (PRONASE - Chapter V of the Energy Transition Act), the two main implementation tools of the law. The law further establishes a Smart Grid Programme to promote grid modernization to maintain a reliable and secure infrastructure to meet electricity demand in an economically efficient and sustainable manner. The Act also stipulates that costs previously externalised (including health and environmental impacts) are now to be included in evaluation of costs associated with operation and expansion of the Electricity Industry. The Act abrogates the Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and the Financing of the Energy Transition (LAERFTE 2008), the Law for the Sustainable Use of Energy (LASE 2008) and any related legal provisions opposing this new Act. The funds from the Energy Transition Fund established by LAERFTE are to be transferred to the Federal Budget and redirected as new funds for energy transition and sustainable energy use. The 2017 Regulations under the Energy Transition Act were passed to regulate the mechanisms and procedures for the implementation of the law in the areas of sustainable use of energy, clean energy and reduction of emissions from the electricity sector. The National Commission for the Efficient Use of Energy published an updated catalog listing equipment and devices on which manufacturers, importers, distributors, and sellers must provide energy consumption information, as well as the forms in which such information must be presented.

														2019.0		Law 13.203 on Renegotiation of the hydrological risk of electricity generation and other matters related to electricity generation	legislative	The Law 13.203 adds some benefits for renewables, and changes a number of measures in the local electricity sector. It seeks to resolve Brazil's hydrological risk and create a new subsidy model to increase the attractiveness of renewable investments. Under the new law, the hydropower generating companies can protect themselves against droughts with the permission to buy and stock renewable energy, in a similar fashion to reserve energy auctions. For generators of solar, wind, biomass and cogeneration power, the government can now also provide rebates of up to 50 per cent in transmission and distribution tariffs. The law also lowers the usage fee for new plants of auto-generation renewable systems and facilitates reorganisation of shareholding of special purpose entities to drive investments in new renewable power plants.

														2018.0		Organic Law on the Public Service of Electricity	legislative	Ecuador's new Electricity Law, adopted 16 January 2015, explicitly states the objective of promoting renewable energy sources (including biomass from solid waste) and energy efficiency, and makes the state the key actor in the electricity industry. The Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) oversees renewable energy policy and planning. The generation, transmission, distribution and commercialisation of electricity are defined as public service, to be provided primarily by the public sector, under the guidance of the newly created Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL - previously National Electricity Board CONELEC). Transmission and distribution of electricity is under the responsibility of state-(majority)-owned companies. Private entities may build and operate power plants and transmission and distribution lines, as long as their generated power does not exceed 50MW. The law also provides for preferential regulations for renewable energy, in particular prioritizing rural-electrification projects. The Electricity Master Plan and the National Energy Efficiency Plan are to be developed by MEER. The Electricity Law replaces the Electricity Sector Law (11996) in its most recent version.

														2021.0		Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016	legislative	The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on 18 December 2015, renews tax credit programs for wind and solar electricity generation and incorporates a phase-out schedule for these support programs, providing some stability for the renewable energy market. The Act extends the 'production tax credit' (PTC) for wind facilities provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code per kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity production for facilities beginning construction before 1 January 2020. This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019. The Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program. The ITC program applies similar percentage-based phase-out support as the PTC program. The Act extends the ITC program for solar energy until 2021, with a percentage-based phase-out provision. The energy credit reduces from 30% to 26% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2019 and further to 22% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2020. It is estimated that the solar ITC provision of the Act will add '220,000 new jobs by 2020, cut 100 million tons of emissions, and lead to $133 billion invested in the U.S. economy' (http://www.seia.org/news/seia-celebrates-extension-itc).

														2023.0		Law 13-09 on renewable energy, regulated by Decree 2-10-578	legislative	This law provides a legal framework for the development of renewable energy projects in Morocco. These are defined as all sources of energy that are naturally renewable, particularly solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, wave and tidal energy, as well as energy generated through biomass, waste and biogas (but excluding hydraulic energy with installed power above 30MW). The law prioritises the development of renewable sources in order to promote energy security, access to energy, sustainable development, reduction of GHG emissions, reduction of deforestation, and integration/harmonisation of Morocco's renewable energy production with other Euro-Mediterranean markets. Originally passed in 2010, the latest version from December 2015, introduces a net metering scheme for solar and wind power plants connected to the high-voltage grid, and in the future also those connected at the middle and low-voltage level. In particular, the law calls for regulation detailing the conditions for investors in solar-PV to benefit from opening of the low-voltage grid to renewable power installations. Private investors in renewable power in general will be able to sell their surplus output to the grid, but no more than 20 per cent of their annual production. The exact terms and conditions of the net metering scheme will be set by regulation. The law further regulates the electricity sector and creates an authorisation/declaration system, depending on the capacity of the facility: a declaration is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is between 20kW and 2MW; an authorisation is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is equal to or higher than 2MW. In respect of facilities that produce thermal energy, there is only a declaration if the capacity is equal to or higher than 8MW. It also allows the supply and export of the electricity produced to the local market and/or through the national grid and interconnections with other countries.

														2027.0		Regulations on feed-in-tariff for renewable energy sourced electricity in Nigeria 2015	legislative	The feed-in tariff regulation builds on the Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005 that opened up the sector to competition and supports small producers, It aims to make use of Nigeria's vast potential for renewable energy by stimulating private investment. It specifies that a total of 1,000MW by 2018 and 2,000 MW by 2020 should be generated through renewables such as biomass, small hydropower, wind and solar, and connected to the grid. The power distribution companies should source minimum 50 per cent of their total supply from renewables. A distinction is made between small and large generation plants: electricity procured from small plants (1 MW to 30 MW) can automatically be integrated as renewable energy; for large plants (>30MW) a competitive procurement process needs to be initiated.

														2029.0		Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000	legislative	"The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 in its latest version as of 10 March 2016, also called ""Act for the establishment and administration of a scheme to encourage additional electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and for related purposes"", aims to: ""encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable"" (Art 3). These objectives are to be reached through issuing of certificates for the generation of electricity, with two types of renewable energy certificates: large?scale generation certificates, created in relation to the generation of electricity by accredited power stations; and small?scale technology certificates, created in relation to the installation of solar water heaters and small generation units (Art 17B). The certificates can only be issued for eligible renewable energy sources, including hydro, wave, tide, ocean, wind, solar, geothermal?aquifer, hot dry rock, energy crops, wood waste, agricultural waste, waste from processing of agricultural products, food waste, food processing waste, bagasse, black liquor, biomass?based components of municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sewage gas and biomass?based components of sewage, and any other energy source prescribed by the regulations. (Art 17). Certain purchasers (called liable entities) are required to surrender a specified number of certificates for the electricity that they acquire during a year. Liable entity is defined as ""a person who, during a year, makes a relevant acquisition (wholesale acquisition or wholesale notional acquisition - author's note) of electricity"" (Art 35). Exemption applies if: ""the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 km from the point at which the electricity is used; (ii) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points"" (Art 31). Where a liable entity does not have enough certificates to surrender in a year, it will have to pay renewable energy shortfall charge. There are 2 types of renewable energy shortfall charge: ""large?scale generation shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of large?scale generation certificates it surrenders and the renewable energy power percentage; and small?scale technology shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of small?scale technology certificates it surrenders and the small?scale technology percentage"" (Art 34A)."

														2035.0		Electrify Africa Act	legislative	The law legislates the US initiative and goal to provide access to power for at least 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020, and to enable the installation of an additional 20,000 megawatts of electricity capacity by 2020. The law supports a broad variety of power generation options, including oil, coal and natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable sources of power, as well as energy efficiency and distribution and transmission systems upgrades. The Electricity Africa Act however particularly promotes renewable energy projects, as the law requires the U.S. government to promote the spread of distributed renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, including off-grid lighting and power. The priority given to off-grid generation is an endorsement of existing efforts, already carried out by a sub-initiative of Power Africa Initiative (see below). To create lasting infrastructures, the law seeks to promote policies to facilitate private financing and public-private partnerships, allow independent producers' participation in electricity markets, and encourage other regulatory reforms in the power sector. The law calls on the US to partner with sub-Saharan African countries, international and regional financial institutions and the private sector to meet the above goals and implement a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The Electricity Africa Act does not allocate new funds to the US agencies, but builds on and backs the Power Africa Initiative, launched in 2013 with a goal of doubling access to electricity across sub-Saharan Africa. The Initiative commits the US to US$7 billion support to the energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa. The law requires the President of the U.S. to submit to the US Senate, within 6 months of the law's enactment, a report outlining a multiyear strategy for reaching the objectives of the law. The Electricity Africa Act also directs U.S. government agencies, such as US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US Trade and Development Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to prioritize loans, grants and technical support for power generation and transmission projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The President of the U.S. is allowed by the law to establish an interagency working group to coordinate efforts among the agencies.

														1670.0		Plan for Renewable Energy in Spain PER 2011-2020	executive	The Plan defines the strategy to continue the growth and development of renewable energy. The PER is based on the essential elements set forth in the PANER, and it is an answer to the Sustainable Economy Law, which requires the government to draw up renewable energy plans in order to reach the renewable energy national targets. The Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), of the Secretariat of State for Energy of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism is responsible for its follow-up. The Plan offers an additional analysis in relation to the PANER, including a detailed sectorial analysis covering a technological development outlook and costs forecast. Additionally, the Plan had to undergo a Strategic Environmental Assessment process to harmonise its environmental objectives with the planning process. During the preparation of this plan, the Parliamentary sub-committee in charge of outlining the Spanish energy strategy for the next 25 years, adjusted the national 2020 target for renewable energy to 20.8% of gross final energy consumption, in response to the effects of the current economic downturn. This change was transferred to the PER 2011-2020. In order to support the Plan, 15 general and sectorial studies have been completed, analysing numerous technical, economic, social and environmental aspects.

														2058.0		Fundamental Law on Energy Policy (Basic Act on Energy Policy) and its Strategic Plans (Law No. 71 of 2002)	legislative	"A lawmaker-initiated legislation, this Law sought to set out the country's fundamental and overall energy policy direction after the approval of the Diet. It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction. A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above. The Plan is sent to discussion and adoption by the Diet, and to date four plans have been adopted (October 2003, March 2007, June 2010, April 2014). The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan (April 2014) added safety into the basic policy perspective, on top of the 3 elements ('the 3Es') mentioned in the previous plans: energy security, economic efficiency and environment (collectively known as '3E+S'). Diversification of energy sources and flexible and efficient energy demand structure are the two basic pillars of energy policy, reflecting the learning from the 2011 energy crisis. Promotion of resilient energy supply structure and improvement of self-sufficiency of energy supply are emphasised as national interest for energy policy. In particular, the Fourth Strategic Energy Plan sets the following targets: Efficient lighting equipment (e.g. LED lighting and organic EL lighting): target ""penetration rate of 100% on a flow basis by 2020 and on a stock basis by 2030"" (page 39) Low-emission vehicles: target increase in the ""ratio of next-generation vehicles to all new vehicles to 50%-70% by 2030 while promoting comprehensive measures, including steps to improve traffic flow such as the development of loop routes and other trunk road networks and introduction of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which will contribute to energy efficiency' (page 40) Storage batteries: promote introduction by ""lowering their cost and improving their performance through technological development and international standardization so that Japanese companies related to the storage battery business will capture a share of 50% in the global storage battery market (20 trillion yen) by 2020' (page 76) Fuel cell vehicles: ""promote installation of hydrogen refuelling stations, targeted increase in the share of next-generation vehicles to 50-70% of all new vehicles by 2030' (page 68)"		Japan	JPN	Transportation,Energy		Mitigation	Law	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Research And Development, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation		published
														2060.0		Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010 (Act No. 67 of 2010)	legislative	The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act requires energy efficiency information in the form of a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, to be provided when commercial office over a certain metrage is offered for sale or lease. The most recent Commercial Buildings Disclosure Programme, updated over June-September 2016, lowered the mandatory disclosure threshold on commercial office buildings from 2,000 to 1,000 square meters. This should see an additional 1,000 commercial buildings now disclose their energy efficiency when they sell or lease their property and aims to deliver more than $50 million in energy savings, and approximately 3.5 million tonnes of emission reductions over five years. Disclosure changes will commence 1 July 2017. In relation to lowering the threshold, the frequency of required tenancy lighting assessment was lowered, to every five years instead of each year. This provision entered into effect as of September 1st 2016. Heavy financial penalties apply for non-compliance. The aim of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act is to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's large office buildings by helping to provide buyers and tenants with credible, comparable energy efficiency information to take into account in their market decisions. An update in effect since 1 July 2015 reduces the regulatory burden on building owners and landlords and waives the requirement to provide a certificate under certain circumstances.

														1702.0		Tanzania Agriculture Climate Resilience Plan	executive	Subsequent to the National Climate Change Strategy (2012), the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security, and Co-operatives (MAFC) sought to outline a sector specific response to climate change impacts. This plan aims to provide the crop-agriculture sub-sector of Tanzania with a risk-based analysis and, subsequently, a plan for meeting the most urgent challenges posed by climate change. Following from a risk assessment detailed in the Plan, three priority risks are identified: (i) amplified water stress; (ii) decreased crop yield, and (iii) increased vulnerability of smallholder farmers. Following from the risk analysis, the plan outlines four 'priority resilience actions:' (i) improving agricultural land and water management, (ii) accelerating uptake of climate smart agriculture (CSA), (iii) improving risk management to reduce climate-related shocks, (iv) strengthening knowledge and systems to target climate action. Specific policy highlights aimed at addressing the former include: the establishment of pest, disease, and early warning systems; the development of policy briefs and financial incentives to assist with mainstreaming CSA into agricultural programmes; the updating of irrigation master plans to consider availability and climate; incentivising the development of water management technologies. The plan estimates the cost of implementation is USD25m/year over 5 years, 80% of which will need to come from outside the government of Tanzania. The plan further commits the MAFC to establishing a climate change monitoring framework with reporting procedures, targets and milestones, reporting plans, and defined indicators.

It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027. The government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027. Emissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development. By 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027. The Plan envisages significant reductions in methane emissions from landfill by 2050, as part of the move towards a zero waste economy.

Energy currently constitutes 80% of Costa Rica's GHG emissions. It complements the National Development Plan 2015 -2018, which also calls for enhancing the use of renewable sources and improving efficiency in the use of energy, especially in the public sector (sectoral objectives 2 and 3). The Plan defines energy efficiency and distributed electricity generation as priorities for action and calls for the renovation of the vehicle fleet to include low carbon technologies, the promotion of sustainable public transport and the mainstreaming of clean fuels, in particular biofuels. Altogether, the Plan is organized along seven axes - four in the electricity production sector and three in the transport sector: Improving energy efficiency Optimal distributed electricity generation Sustainability of the electricity grid Sustainable electricity generation development More environmentally friendly vehicle fleet Sustainable public transport Cleaner fuels For each strategical axis, the Plan defines a set of concrete objectives (institutional and administrative reforms, new efficiency standards and certification, tariff adjustments, creation of funds, etc.), with varying deadlines for short/medium/long term. Concrete objectives include: Expand renewable energy projects to reach 731.9 MW by 2018, additional 470 MW over 2019-2023, and additional 910 MW over 2024-2030 (subject to revision) Expand the transmission lines by additional 313.5 km by 2018 Expand the distribution grid by additional 1921 km by 2018 By 2030, all houses not connected to the grid should have individual photovoltaic systems"		Costa Rica	CRI	Transportation,Energy		Mitigation	Plan	Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation		published
														2022.0		Clean Power Plan	executive	The Clean Power Plan, developed under the Clean Air Act, sets state targets for carbon emissions reductions, and offers a flexible framework under which states may meet those targets. The aim is to reduce national electricity sector emissions by an estimated 32 % below 2005 levels by 2030 (nearly 870 million tons), in particular in two subcategories of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units: fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (mostly coal- and oil-fired power plants), and natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units. Options for cutting emissions include investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, natural gas, and nuclear power, and shifting away from coal-fired power. The Plan also aims to limit shift to natural gas and promote renewables. Targets differ across states because of each state's unique mix of electricity-generation resources, as well as technological feasibilities, costs, and emissions reduction potentials. States are free to combine any of the options in a flexible manner to meet their targets or join together in multi-state or regional compacts to reduce their carbon emissions through the lowest cost options, including through emissions trading programs. States must submit a final plan, or an initial plan with a request for an extension (potentially until September 2018), by September 6, 2016. Compliance period starts in 2022. The Clean Power Plan also provides incentives for early deployment of renewables and efficiency measures benefiting low-income communities, as well as tools to assist states in implementing market-based approaches. A Federal Implementation Plan is also being designed, for EPA to use in states that do not adopt adequate individual implementation plans. The Clean Power Plan is expected to contribute significant pollution reductions, potentially resulting in: Climate-related benefits of $20 billion Health benefits of $14-$34 billion Net benefits of $26-$45 billion Note: In February 2016, the US Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Electric Generating Units, pending judicial review.

														1619.0		National Climate Change Strategy	executive	The National Climate Change Strategy 2012 (replacing a previous version published in 2008), produced by the National Climate Change Secretariat, provides a comprehensive overview of Singapore's response to climate change. It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels. The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change: - Long-term and integrated planning; - Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and - Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets. It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change: - Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors; - Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change; - Harnessing green growth opportunities; and - Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies). The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include: - Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas; - Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills; - Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances; - Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings; - Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and - Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes. The strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model. Finally, it outlines the various local and international partnerships (e.g. with other countries/cities) that Singapore is engaged in.

														1684.0		An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy	legislative	Passed by the Riksdag in 2009, these laws originating in two government bills form the basis of Sweden's flagship climate policy, known as 'an Integrated Climate and Energy Policy. The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited). The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector. Targets outlined in this legislation include: - 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) - 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020 - 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008) - 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector - by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating - by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels - by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden.

														1731.0		National Climate Change Policy	executive	As the document outlines, 'the goal of the policy is to ensure a harmonised and co-ordinated approach towards a climate- resilient and low-carbon development path for sustainable development in Uganda'. The policy notes that the level of knowledge on climate change and its impacts remains low in Uganda. Therefore, it seeks to raise awareness of climate change, targeting sectorial weaknesses (to be determined by different governmental agencies and ministries) in the short term but providing information for a wide variety of stakeholders in the long term. To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building. The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables. The adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda's approach to adaption to climate change. Moreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions. The Policy Committee on Environment is also strengthened to help guide climate change policy implementation. As annex to the Climate Change Policy, the Cost Implementation Strategy provides a more detailed account on the implementation of the Policy, including an indicative costing for the programmes and activities to be developed. Thus, according to the document, the total cost for the implementation of the Climate Change Policy is estimated in approximately 3.9 billion dollars over a 15-year period.

														1643.0		National Climate Change Response Policy White Paper (NCCRP)	executive	The National Climate Change Response Policy is a comprehensive plan to address both mitigation and adaptation in the short, medium and long term (up to 2050). GHG emissions are set to stop increasing at the latest by 2020-2025, to stabilise for up to 10 years and then to decline in absolute terms. Strategies are specified for the following areas: - Carbon Pricing - Water - Agriculture and commercial forestry - Health - Biodiversity and ecosystems - Human settlements - Disaster risk reduction and management The policy has two main objectives: first, to manage inevitable climate change impacts through interventions that build and sustain social, economic and environmental resilience and emergency response capacity. Secondly, to make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. The Policy specifies strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, making use of the short-, medium- and long-term planning horizons (up to five years from publication of policy, up to 20 years, up to 2050, respectively). The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years. Concerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a 'carbon budgets' approach. It also proposed the deployment of a range of economic instruments, including the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies or entities where a carbon budget approach has been selected. Energy Efficiency and Energy and Demand Management flagship programmes cover development and facilitation of an aggressive energy efficiency programme in industry, building on previous Demand Side Management programmes, and covering non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured programme will be established with appropriate initiatives, incentives and regulation, along with a well-resourced information collection and dissemination process. Local governments are encouraged to take an active part in demand-side management. There is a short-term transportation flagship programme, which aims to facilitate the development of an enhanced public transportation programme to promote lower-carbon mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet by 2020. The planned rail recapitalisation programme is considered an important component of this Flagship Programme due to its projected contribution to modal shifts of passengers and freight. The programme further introduces a Government Vehicle Efficiency Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of the government vehicle fleet by 2020, by setting procurement objectives for efficient technology vehicles such as electric vehicles. In the medium term, the plan calls for significant up-scaling of energy efficiency applications in transportation; and for promoting transport-related interventions including transportation modal shifts (road to rail, private to public transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g. electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels. The principles of the White Paper include prioritising co-operation and the promotion of research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation, lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies, practices and processes for employment by existing or new sectors or sub-sectors. All fields and flagship programmes include a key element of research and development, data collection and analysis tools in their respective areas. Adaptation efforts are prioritised, acknowledging the vulnerability of the country. Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management. In order to monitor success of measures, South Africa will, within two years of the publication of the policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response Measurement and Evaluation System.
